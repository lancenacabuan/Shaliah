# The Biblical Unitarian Jesus: Recovering the Human Messiah through Jewish Agency and Wisdom Christology**

This study reexamines the identity of Jesus Christ from a **Biblical Unitarian** standpoint, which maintains that God is one Person—the Father alone—and that Jesus is not God by nature, but rather God’s appointed and exalted Messiah. Central to this understanding are two crucial concepts deeply rooted in Jewish thought: the **Shaliah** principle of agency and **Wisdom Christology**. By revisiting these themes, we find a coherent and historically grounded Christology that challenges the later doctrinal developments of Trinitarianism and reorients us toward the original gospel proclaimed by Jesus and his apostles.

At the heart of the Jewish worldview is the foundational affirmation of **monotheism**, summed up in the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one.” This singularity of God was not a point of contention in Jesus’ time; in fact, Jesus explicitly affirmed it when asked about the greatest commandment, saying in Mark 12:29 that God is one, and there is no other but Him. Jesus did not seek to revise or reinterpret this truth—he upheld it as the core of faith and practice. The New Testament nowhere teaches that God is three Persons in one divine essence. Instead, what we find are powerful affirmations of a strict monotheism shared by Jesus, his disciples, and the early Jewish-Christian community.

In the **Second Temple period**, Jewish monotheism remained robust but expressed divine activity in flexible ways. Attributes of God—such as His Word (Logos), Wisdom (Sophia), and Spirit (Ruach)—were frequently **personified**, often poetically or metaphorically. For instance, Wisdom is depicted as a woman crying out in the streets in Proverbs 1, or as a master craftsperson beside God in Proverbs 8. Yet these literary devices were not understood as literal hypostases or divine persons alongside God. They were **extensions of God's character**, not coequal beings. This context is essential for interpreting the Christological language of the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of John and Pauline epistles.

One of the most crucial principles in understanding the representation of divine agency in the Bible is the **Jewish concept of “Shaliah”** (שָׁלִיחַ)—a legal and theological idea denoting an **authorized agent** who carries out the will of the sender. In rabbinic thought, as recorded in the Mishnah (Berakhot 5:5), it is said, *“The agent is as the one who sends him.”* This means that when an agent is commissioned by someone, the agent’s actions are considered as those of the sender. The agent does not become the sender; he remains distinct in person and being, but is treated functionally as the sender’s voice, presence, and authority.

This concept is evident throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. **Moses**, for example, is called “God” to Pharaoh in Exodus 7:1—not because he is divine, but because he stands in God’s place as His spokesman. Similarly, **the Angel of the LORD** frequently speaks in the first person as God (Genesis 22:11–18), yet is clearly distinct from Yahweh in other verses (e.g., Zechariah 1:12–13). In **Psalm 82**, human **judges** are referred to as “gods,” and this passage is later quoted by Jesus himself in John 10:34 to defend his own use of divine language. Even **Davidic kings** are addressed with exalted titles, such as in Psalm 45:6–7, where the king is called “God” in a representative, not ontological, sense. In all these examples, the figures in question act **on behalf of God**, functioning as shaliahs—agents endowed with divine authority but never identified as Yahweh in essence.

The New Testament portrayal of Jesus, particularly in the **Gospel of John**, aligns naturally with this **agency model**. Jesus is consistently described as **the one sent by God**. Over forty times in John, Jesus refers to himself as having been “sent” by the Father, highlighting his commissioned role. In John 17:3, Jesus prays to the Father, identifying Him alone as “the only true God,” and himself as the one whom God has sent. He does not equate himself with God ontologically but defines himself through mission and obedience. In John 13:16, Jesus uses the language of **apostolos** (sent one) to emphasize the principle of agency: *“The one who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him.”* Such language resonates deeply with the Jewish legal understanding of the shaliah.

Further support for a high yet non-divine Christology emerges from the study of **Wisdom Christology**. In Jewish wisdom literature—such as Proverbs, Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon—**Wisdom** is described as present at creation, proceeding from God, and even sent to dwell among humanity. For example, Proverbs 8:22–31 portrays Wisdom as created and working beside God during creation. Sirach 24 speaks of Wisdom coming from the mouth of the Most High and making its dwelling in Israel. Importantly, none of these texts suggest that Wisdom is an ontological person distinct from God. Rather, Wisdom represents God’s **self-expression**, His plan and purpose manifested in the world.

In this light, **Jesus is best understood as the embodiment of God’s Wisdom**—God’s redemptive purpose and moral insight made flesh. This is the proper context for interpreting **John 1:1–14**. When John writes, *“In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,”* he is not introducing a second divine person. Rather, he draws from Jewish traditions where God’s Wisdom or Word represents His creative and salvific will. “The Word became flesh” (v.14) means that God’s eternal purpose—His Logos—found full expression in the human person of Jesus. This is analogous to Sirach’s claim that Wisdom “took root in Zion” (Sirach 24:12), not implying incarnation in the later Trinitarian sense, but divine initiative realized in human history.

Paul likewise identifies Christ as **“the wisdom of God”** in 1 Corinthians 1:24, reinforcing the idea that Jesus is God’s plan personified, not a preexistent deity. In **Colossians 1:15–20**, Paul describes Christ as the “firstborn of all creation” and the one “through whom all things were created.” Yet this hymn is not about Genesis creation per se, but about **new creation**—God’s reconciliation of all things through Christ. The Greek prepositions used (*en*, *dia*, *eis*) can denote “in,” “through,” or “because of,” and should be read in light of the resurrection and exaltation, not eternal generation.

Similarly, other so-called “high Christology” texts yield to more contextual readings. **Philippians 2:5–11** describes Christ as being in the “form of God” yet humbling himself to the point of death. Trinitarians see this as a reference to preexistent deity, but the passage more likely refers to **Messianic status**. The “form of God” reflects functional representation and exalted role, not divine essence. The “emptying” (kenosis) is an act of **voluntary humility**, not a metaphysical transformation.

**Hebrews 1:1–3** declares that God has spoken through His Son, “through whom He made the ages.” The Greek word *aiōnas* is best translated as “ages” or “eras,” indicating the Son’s role in shaping **salvation history**, not material creation. Jesus is the heir of all things, exalted **after** his resurrection, not preexistent alongside the Father.

Jesus’ **own testimony** reinforces this framework. He never claims to be God in the ontological sense. In **John 17:3**, he calls the Father “the only true God.” In **Matthew 19:17**, he distinguishes himself from God by saying, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.” In **John 14:28**, he states, “The Father is greater than I,” and in **Mark 10:40**, he admits that positions of honor in the Kingdom are not his to give. These statements make little sense if Jesus were coequal with the Father in a Trinitarian sense.

The **apostolic teaching** continues this theme. In **Acts 2:22**, Peter refers to Jesus as “a man attested to you by God.” God raises him from the dead (Acts 2:32) and exalts him (Acts 2:36). Paul, too, refers to Jesus as “a man” (1 Timothy 2:5), “the last Adam” (1 Corinthians 15:45), and “the image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). Jesus is always portrayed as **distinct from God**, yet uniquely honored because of his obedience and faithfulness.

From a theological perspective, **Trinitarianism presents insurmountable difficulties**. The idea that three persons are one essence is not only absent from Scripture, but it also violates the principle of non-contradiction. Jesus cannot be fully God and fully man in the same sense without becoming a **hybrid being** foreign to the biblical text. Historically, the doctrine developed over centuries: the **Council of Nicaea (325 AD)** introduced *homoousios* (same essence), and the **Council of Constantinople (381 AD)** finalized the Trinitarian formula. These councils relied on Greek philosophical categories—**substance, nature, personhood**—not on biblical exegesis.

By contrast, the Biblical Unitarian model maintains coherence and fidelity to Scripture. Jesus is **God’s agent** (Shaliah), **His anointed Messiah**, and **the embodiment of divine Wisdom**. He is called “god” in a functional sense—just as Moses, kings, and judges were—never implying ontological identity with Yahweh.

Some common objections arise. When **Thomas says, “My Lord and my God!”** (John 20:28), it is either an exclamation of awe or a recognition that **God is working through Jesus**, consistent with agency. In **John 8:58**, when Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am,” the Greek *egō eimi* can simply mean “I am he,” not a divine self-declaration. The blind man in **John 9:9** uses the same phrase. Worship of Jesus, too, does not demand deity; the Greek *proskuneō* means reverence or homage, and was used for kings and prophets.

In conclusion, **Jesus is not God**, but the **Son of God**, the one anointed and sent to fulfill the Father’s redemptive plan. He is the **Wisdom of God made flesh**, not a preexistent divine being but a man through whom God executes His will. The **true gospel**—that the one God has raised up a faithful servant to rule His kingdom—is preserved and clarified through this lens. In honoring Jesus as Messiah and Lord, we obey the Shema, worship the Father alone, and rightly discern the mission and person of Jesus Christ, God’s ultimate **shaliah**.
