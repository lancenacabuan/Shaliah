Rediscovering a Biblical Christology: Jesus as God's Agent and Wisdom

An exhaustive inquiry into the person and work of Jesus Christ, when stripped of centuries of Hellenistic philosophical overlay and post-apostolic creedal formulations, reveals a Christology profoundly rooted in the monotheistic soil of Second Temple Judaism, a Christology best understood through the complementary lenses of the Jewish legal principle of agency (shaliah) and the rich Hebraic tradition of personified Wisdom (Chokmah). This study posits that the dominant Trinitarian orthodoxy, which conceives of Jesus as an ontologically co-equal and co-eternal person within a triune Godhead, represents a significant deviation from the pristine, unitarian monotheism espoused by Jesus and the apostles. The biblical portrait, rather, is of Jesus as the ultimate human Shaliach (agent or emissary) of the one true God, his Father, Yahweh. The foundational declaration of Israelite faith, the Shema, insists, "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4). This uncompromising monotheism forms the non-negotiable context for the entire biblical narrative, including the New Testament's presentation of the Messiah. The concept of shaliah, encapsulated in the rabbinic axiom "the one sent is as the one who sent him," was a pervasive legal and theological principle wherein an agent fully represented his principal, bearing his authority, speaking his words, and receiving his honor, without ever being ontologically identical to the principal. This principle is not a novel invention but is deeply embedded in the Hebrew Scriptures; for instance, God tells Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1) and that he would be "as God" to Aaron (Exodus 4:16). The Angel of Yahweh frequently speaks in the first person as God himself (Genesis 16:10–13; Exodus 3:2–6), yet is distinguished from the God who sent him. Likewise, human judges in Israel were called elohim ("gods") because they functioned as God's representatives in judgment (Psalm 82:6), a point Jesus himself explicitly leverages in his defense against charges of blasphemy (John 10:34–36).

The Jewish Scriptures present a rigorous model of divine agency in which a human or angelic envoy, though not ontologically identical with Yahweh, is empowered to speak and act with God’s own authority. In rabbinic terminology this is the shaliah principle, a legal-theoretical paradigm stating that “the sender (shaliah) and the one sent (shaliah al ha-shaliah)” are functionally indistinguishable in executing the sender’s will. Moses, commissioned at the burning bush, declares “the LORD said to me . . .” (Exodus 3:15–17) while subsequently the text refers to Moses himself in the third person as “God” to Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1). Similarly, in Joshua 5:14–15 the commander of the LORD’s host calls himself “the captain of the host of the LORD” yet speaks as the LORD’s envoy rather than a second deity. The decree of Zechariah 3:1–7 portrays Joshua the high priest clothed “with the clean garments"—that is, God’s own righteousness—while still distinct from the LORD he serves. These and countless other narratives (cf. 1 Samuel 2:10; Psalm 82:6) establish a biblical precedent for an agent who, though granted divine titles or called “god” in a functional sense, remains strictly subordinate to the one true God.

It is precisely within this shaliah framework that Jesus’ own claims and the apostolic witness must be situated. His constant refrain is one of subordination and commission: "I have come in my Father's name" (John 5:43); "The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me" (John 14:24); "He who receives me receives Him who sent me" (John 13:20). Even the most exalted titles applied to Jesus are intelligible through this representative lens. Thomas's cry, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28), after the resurrection is not a sudden, unprecedented confession of Trinitarian ontology but rather the ultimate recognition of Jesus as the perfect embodiment of the Father's presence and authority—the supreme agent through whom God is now known and worshipped, fulfilling the precedent of Psalm 82 and the Roman imperial custom of addressing the emperor as *Dominus et Deus noster* (our Lord and God) in a representational, not ontological, capacity. Trinitarian proof-texts, often cited as insurmountable evidence for Jesus’ pre-existent deity, are compellingly reinterpreted through the paradigm of Wisdom Christology. In Jewish thought (Proverbs 8; Sirach 24; Wisdom of Solomon 7–9), God's Wisdom (Chokmah in Hebrew, Sophia in Greek) was poetically personified as the agent of creation and revelation, the intimate counsel of God, yet was understood as an attribute or eternal plan of God, not a distinct hypostasis. The New Testament authors, particularly John and Paul, appropriated this rich symbolic language to articulate the cosmic significance of the man Jesus. The celebrated prologue of John's Gospel—"In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1)—does not describe a second person of the Godhead. Rather, the Logos is God's eternal reason, creative utterance, and redemptive plan. The phrase "with God" (*pros ton theon*) signifies proximity and relation, as in a plan held within the mind of its originator. The anarthrous predicate "and the Word was God" (*kai theos ēn ho logos*) is qualitative, indicating the Logos shared the nature and essence of God, as His perfect expression, not that it was numerically identical to the person of God. The Logos then "became flesh" (John 1:14) not in the sense of a divine person inhabiting a human body, but in the sense that God's eternal plan and self-expression found its ultimate, perfect, and final instantiation in the historical human person, Jesus of Nazareth.

Similarly, other high Christological passages yield to this interpretation. In Colossians 1:15–17, Jesus is the "image of the invisible God," language of perfect representation, not identity. He is the "prototokos," the "firstborn of all creation," a title denoting supreme rank and inheritance rights within God's created order, not chronological precedence to it. The statement that all things were created "in him" and "through him" signifies that God's creational purpose was always oriented toward and culminated in the Messiah as the head of the new creation. In Philippians 2:6–11, Jesus, "being in the form of God" (*en morphē theou*), refers not to his intrinsic divine nature in a pre-human state, but to his glorious status as the sinless Adam and God's plenipotentiary agent on earth. He did not "grasp at" being equal with God but "emptied himself" by relinquishing his rightful messianic glory, choosing instead the path of a servant to the point of a criminal's death. His subsequent exaltation and reception of "the name that is above every name" is a reward bestowed by God for his obedience, a nonsensical transaction if he were already, by nature, Almighty God.

Parallel to the Shaliah motif, the Old Testament enshrines “Wisdom” as a personified yet created attribute of God—eternal in God’s counsels but only made manifest at creation. Proverbs 8 portrays Wisdom as present “when he established the heavens” and as “a master workman” at the cosmic forge, yet Wisdom speaks and acts on God’s behalf rather than as a separate deity. In Hellenistic Judaism, Philo of Alexandria develops this Logos-Wisdom motif, framing the Word as a functional instrument of creation and revelation. Early Christian writers, especially Paul, adopt this Wisdom Christology to articulate Jesus not as an independent hypostasis existing since eternity but as God’s pre-appointed instrument—the divine Logos enfleshed—through whom all things were created (1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:15–17).

When we turn to the New Testament, we observe that early Jewish believers appropriated this agency framework to understand the Messiah. Jesus’ appellation as “Son of Man” (Daniel 7:13–14) echoes an exalted heavenly figure who receives “dominion, glory, and a kingdom” from the Ancient of Days, yet remains a vice-regent rather than co-equal with God. Likewise, in John 17:3 Jesus pleads with the Father, “This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent,” implying that Jesus’ sent-status is ontologically distinct from the Father. The apostolic witness consistently emphasizes Jesus’ dependence on the Father (John 5:19–23; 1 Corinthians 11:3) and confines divine identity strictly to the God of Israel (James 2:19), all while ascribing to Jesus a unique mediatorial role that justifies exclusive obedience and worship.

Traditional Trinitarianism locates passages such as John 1:1, Hebrews 1:3 (“the radiance of his glory and the exact imprint of his nature”), and Philippians 2:6 (“though he was in the form of God”) as proof of Jesus’ ontological co-equality and co-eternity with the Father. However, within a Wisdom and agency framework, “the Word was God” can be read as “the Word was a divine instrument,” much like the temple pillars Jachin and Boaz, which were named “because he establishes” and “because he in strength” but remained symbolic. Hebrews’ language of “exact imprint” (*charakter*) underscores representation, not identity; a seal bears the exact form of a king’s signet yet is not the king himself. Philippians’ “form of God” (*morphe theou*) denotes functional likeness—that Jesus perfectly exemplified God’s character—without implying shared substance. Thus, words of divine prerogative in the New Testament, including “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30), reflect unity of purpose and mission rather than collapsed personal distinctions.

No examination of this model would be complete without addressing Pauline and Johannine passages where Jesus receives worship, forgives sins, and exercises prerogatives reserved for God in the Old Testament. Critics argue that if Jesus is mere agent, divine worship is misdirected. Yet within the biblical economy, worship of an agent is not inherently idolatrous when the agent functions as God’s designated representative—as when the cherubim or the temple itself become loci of divine presence (Exodus 25:22; Ezekiel 10). Jesus authorizes worship precisely because he embodies God’s will; to refuse him is to refuse the Father (Matthew 10:40). Forgiveness of sins (Mark 2:5–12) is likewise rooted in Jesus’ unique appointment as mediator of the new covenant, fulfilling Jeremiah 31:34’s promise that God “will forgive their iniquity,” enacted through his once-for-all sacrifice (Hebrews 8:7–13).

Anticipating further objections, one might cite Revelation 22:13 (“I am the Alpha and the Omega”) to assert eternal deity. Yet apocalyptic literature is rife with metaphorical identifications: Wisdom in Sirach claims “‘I am he . . . from everlasting” yet is clearly a facet of God, not a distinct divine person. Doctrinally, the church’s later creedal formulations emerged within a milieu of Greco-Roman philosophical debates over substance and hypostasis, terms unknown to the biblical authors. While the early church fathers often defended what they called “the deity of Christ,” their philosophical vocabulary imported Platonic categories that reshaped and arguably obscured the Hebraic understanding of agency and embodiment of divine wisdom.

It is crucial to acknowledge the counterargument that this view appears to diminish Christ. However, it does not. This perspective must be carefully distinguished from Arianism, which posited a pre-existent created super-angelic being, and from simple adoptionism. The biblical unitarian view holds that Jesus was uniquely conceived by God's Spirit, lived a sinless human life, and was thus the perfect and sole vehicle for God's redemptive plan—truly the *monogenēs* or "uniquely-begotten" Son. His divinity is therefore functional, representational, and relational, which in the Hebraic mind carried more weight than abstract ontological categories later imported from Greek philosophy, a process evident in the centuries-long development of the doctrine of the Trinity from Nicaea (325 AD) to Constantinople (381 AD) and beyond. The rediscovery of this biblically and historically grounded Christology results in a radical clarification of the gospel itself. The mission of Jesus is no longer a complex intra-Trinitarian drama but the straightforward and profound story of the one God, the Father, acting in and through His chosen human agent, the Messiah Jesus, to defeat sin and death and reconcile the world to Himself (2 Corinthians 5:19). Jesus' work was to perfectly reveal the character of his Father, to serve as the ultimate model of human obedience, to provide the final atoning sacrifice as the unblemished Lamb of God, and to be resurrected and exalted by God as the pioneer of the new creation and Lord over all. The true gospel, therefore, is the proclamation of the Kingdom of the one God, and the call to repentance and faith in His Son, the man Jesus Christ, through whom alone salvation is offered and by whose example we are called to live, all to the glory of God the Father.

Rediscovering Jesus as God’s anointed agent and the living Wisdom of the Creator restores the simplicity and radical monotheism of the apostolic gospel. The true gospel proclaims a single transcendent God who, in the fullness of time, sent his Son—not to reveal another god but to personify and actualize his eternal counsel in history, to suffer and die on behalf of sinful humanity, and to inaugurate the sacred, Spirit-empowered community called to bear witness to God’s reign. This corrected view transforms our worship, our doctrine, and our mission: we worship the Father in the Son by the Spirit, proclaiming one God and entrusting ourselves wholly to the one whom God has sent.
