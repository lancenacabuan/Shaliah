# The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus: Agency (Shaliah) and Wisdom Christology

In **Biblical Unitarianism**, the doctrine of the Trinity is rejected as a post-biblical development.  Advocates point out that the term “Trinity” does not appear in Scripture and that the Bible never explicitly describes one God as three coequal Persons.  As one Unitarian source summarizes, the orthodox Trinity (Father, Son, Spirit as coeternal “one God”) is *“never stated in the Bible”* and must be reconstructed by piecing together various texts.  In this view the Father alone is Almighty God, and Jesus is His unique Son – a created but exalted agent of God.  This perspective highlights that **early Christian creeds** initially said nothing of a threefold God.  For example, the ancient Apostles’ Creed (ca. AD 150–200) simply affirms belief in “the Holy Spirit” without defining three Persons.  Only later (Nicene Creed, 325 AD) was language about Jesus as “eternally begotten, true God” introduced.  Athanasius’s 5th-century Creed then formally codified the Trinity.  Biblical Unitarians argue that the New Testament itself never portrays Jesus as Almighty God, but rather as God’s promised Messiah, “a man approved of God” (Acts 2:22) who is sent by and subordinated to the one true God.

## The Jewish Law of Agency (Shaliah) in Scripture

A key interpretive principle comes from **Jewish law**: the *shaliaḥ* or “agent” principle.  Under this legal concept, an authorized envoy is regarded *as if he were the sender himself*.  In the Talmud it is explicitly stated that “a person’s agent is considered as himself”.  In practice this means that when a proxy speaks or acts on another’s behalf, his words and authority are those of the one who sent him.  This idea is found in Rabbinic sources (Tosafot on *Kiddushin* 42b) and medieval commentaries, and it underlies many scriptural metaphors of divine mission.

Because of this, figures commissioned by God can bear divine titles in a representative sense.  For example, in Exodus 7:1 God tells Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh”.  Here *Elohim* (“God”) is used of Moses; the context shows it means “in authority” – Moses speaks and acts as God’s representative before Egypt’s king.  Likewise, Moses says in Exodus 4:16 that “you shall be to him instead of God”: commentaries explain that Aaron should recognize Moses as God’s mouthpiece.  Thus **Moses in Pharaoh’s court** functions under divine commission, aptly described as “like God” (not that Moses is Almighty, but that Pharaoh must treat Moses’ commands as God’s own).  Similarly, in Psalm 82 God says to the corrupt judges of Israel, *“I said, ‘You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High’”*.  This verse reflects that human judges (who carried God’s word to the people) were metaphorically called “gods.”  Joshua and David, as God’s anointed rulers, were likewise viewed as carrying divine authority.  Jeremiah 1:10 likewise depicts the prophet’s commission: *“I have made you today over nations and over kingdoms…”*, illustrating that God can “set” a human ruler in charge by agency.  In all these cases the one chosen by God is spoken of in elevated terms without implying independent deity.

## Jesus as God’s Sent Agent in John’s Gospel

The New Testament, especially the Gospel of John, repeatedly portrays Jesus as God’s *authorized envoy*.  John explicitly frames Jesus’ identity in *shaliaḥ* terms.  Jesus declares, for example, **“the only true God has sent me”** (John 17:3), identifying himself as *God’s agent*.  A recent study notes that in John’s narrative *“Jesus is the one whom the only true God has sent as his agent”*.  In fact Jesus often speaks of doing what the Father commands and following a mission from heaven.  He calls himself the Father’s *“apostolos”* – literally “sent one” – in John 13:16: *“the apostle (apostolos) is not greater than the one who sent him”*.  In John 5–12 many passages show Jesus acting explicitly on behalf of God: “As the Father gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not exist, so also the Son gives life to whom he will” (John 5:21), or “For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me” (John 6:38).  Jesus is repeatedly *“obedient”* to the Father (Philippians 2:8), speaking only what the Father has given him, and promising that the one who honors the Son honors the Father (John 5:23).

Modern scholars of John stress this agency language.  As Dustin Smith observes, Jesus in John’s Gospel is consistently “portrayed throughout the narrative as \[the] genuine agent of the true God”.  Andrew Lincoln similarly summarizes Jesus as “God’s authorized agent, who fully and reliably represents the intentions and cause of the one who has sent him”.  In this view, all of Jesus’ teaching and miracles are done in the Father’s name (not on his own authority): *“For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment…”* (John 12:49).

## Divine Titles and High Christology Reinterpreted

Many titles applied to Jesus in Scripture are understood differently under *shaliaḥ* and *wisdom* categories.  Although Trinitarians see some passages as attributing deity to Jesus, Unitarians reframe them.  For instance, the famous prologue “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1) is normally taken to mean full divinity.  Grammarians note that in Greek theos (“God”) with no article emphasizes the nature of the Word.  Yet Unitarians point out that elsewhere in John the phrase *“ego eimi”* (“I am”) simply identifies a person.  In fact, not long after John 8:58, a blind man says of himself “I am” (John 9:9), clearly not a claim to deity.  Biblical Unitarian writers note that the same Greek words are translated “I am” or “I am the one” in different contexts.  Thus when Jesus says, *“Before Abraham was, I am”* (John 8:58), Unitarian interpreters argue he is identifying himself as the promised Messiah – “I am he” – rather than uttering the divine name of Exodus 3:14.  He does not quote God’s full self-designation (“I AM WHO I AM”), but simply uses “ego eimi,” a common phrase meaning “I am the one \[you speak of]”.  Indeed, the Old Testament context shows Abraham “saw” Christ’s day by faith (John 8:56; Hebrews 11:10), and so from God’s viewpoint Christ as God’s plan “existed” before Abraham lived.

Similarly, when Jesus declares *“I and the Father are one”* (John 10:30), Unitarians emphasize the immediate context and grammar.  Trinitarian commentators point out that “one” (Greek *hen*, neuter gender) suggests a unity of essence.  But Jesus’ interlocutors immediately accuse him of blasphemy, and he responds by quoting Psalm 82:6: *“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, You are gods’?”* (John 10:34–36).  In doing so he reminds them that Scripture itself calls certain divinely appointed judges “gods” (Psalm 82:6) without conferring on them the divine nature.  Thus the Unitarian interpretation reads John 10:30 not as an ontological identity with God, but as a statement of solidarity or purpose.  Jesus is the “one” sent by God, doing the Father’s work, so that his followers safely abide in him as they would in the Father (John 10:27–29).  Even if Jesus distinguishes himself from the Father (“the ‘I’” vs. “the Father” in the Greek), he emphasizes their unity of will and mission, not literal coequal personhood.

Other “divine” appellations are similarly reframed.  For example, Revelation 3:14 calls Christ “the Originator (ἀρχηγὸς) of God’s creation”.  Trinitarians might see that as Creator-language.  Unitarians note the Greek *archēgos* can mean “prince” or “author” of a plan – like a founder of a covenant – rather than the craftsman God Himself.  In Ephesians 3:9–11 Christ is described as part of God’s hidden plan from eternity; Colossians 1:15’s title “firstborn of all creation” can mean first in rank or inheritance (cf. Psalm 89:27), not necessarily first made.  Proverbs 8 personifies God’s Wisdom as present at creation: *“The LORD created me at the beginning of his work… From everlasting I was established”*.  Biblical Unitarians see such texts as background: Jesus, as the incarnate **Wisdom of God**, fulfills those patterns.  1 Corinthians 1:24 explicitly calls Christ *“the power of God and the wisdom of God”*, highlighting his role as God’s manifested wisdom rather than implying an independent divine being.  John’s “Word” (Logos) can be understood as God’s plan or reason made flesh, in line with Jewish ideas of Wisdom and the Word.  Indeed, recent scholarship on *Wisdom Christology* shows that John’s Gospel draws heavily on personified Wisdom imagery.  Smith’s study points out how John parallels Proverbs and other Jewish texts: Wisdom is at God’s side, comes from heaven, and is “incarnate” in history (even given as a woman in marriage contexts).  Thus when John 1:14 says *“the Word became flesh”*, one can read it as God’s *wisdom/plan becoming reality* in Jesus, with the Old Testament Wisdom-language providing the context.  John 7:34 (“You will seek me and you will not find me…”) mirrors Proverbs 1:28 (“they will seek me and find me not”), fitting the motif that divine wisdom (personified) was rejected by the wise and fools of Israel, just as Jesus (embodying that wisdom) was rejected by the leaders.

In summary, many texts used as high Christology “proofs” can be reread in a Unitarian paradigm.  Rather than a second eternal person, Jesus is portrayed as *God’s eternal wisdom and messenger* who entered history to fulfill God’s purpose.  John 1:1 (“the Word was God”) can emphasize the divine origin of the plan (with *theos* qualitatively), John 8:58 (“I am”) can mean “I am he/the Messiah”, and John 10:30 can mean “we are one in purpose.”  Titles like Son of Man, Son of God, Logos, and “true Light” reflect Jesus’ authority and mission from God.  Ephesians 3:9–11 and Colossians 1:15–20 describe Jesus prefigured in God’s wisdom, not as an independent deity, affirming that “in \[Christ] all things were created” as God’s plan executed, not that Jesus personally created everything.  Even Revelation’s “Alpha and Omega” is read as “the beginning and the consummation of God’s purposes through the Messiah.”

## Rediscovering the Biblical Jesus and His Mission

Viewed this way, the **gospel** is recast in strict monotheistic terms: there is one God (the Father), and Jesus is His Son sent to implement God’s plan of salvation.  Biblical Unitarians stress passages like Acts 2:22 (Peter calling Jesus “a man attested by God”) and Acts 4:12 (“there is salvation in no one else” but Jesus) to underline that Jesus’ uniqueness lies in his faithfulness, not in his substance.  As one Unitarian summary puts it, Jesus is *“the only begotten Son of God”* who lived a sinless life and died on the cross, and now stands at God’s right hand “as God’s second in command, administering the things of God”.  In this view, Jesus perfectly revealed and enacted God’s wisdom: he loved the Father, trusted Him completely, and taught others to seek the one God (Matthew 4:10; Mark 12:29–30).  His resurrection vindicates God’s acceptance of that mission.  His role as high priest or mediator (Hebrews 9:15) is not that of deity but of divinely sent intercessor.

In conclusion, the **Biblical Unitarian** perspective argues that returning to the Jewish notions of *shaliaḥ* (agency) and wisdom clarifies Jesus’ identity.  Jesus is the promised Messiah, the “sent one” through whom God’s singular will is accomplished.  This approach sees the New Testament emphasis on Jesus’ divine connection (miracles done in God’s name, exclusive authority over life and judgment, unique sonship) as consistent with Israel’s monotheism – anointing Jesus as God’s wise agent and Master-plan personified – rather than introducing a second divine person.  By this reading, one still worships Jesus (as Lord and Christ), but does so as one honors God’s chosen Servant.  Proponents contend that this aligns with the earliest Hebrew understanding of God’s unity and the scriptural portrait of a Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) who ultimately reigns as God’s instrument.  Thus the “true gospel,” from their standpoint, is recovered by seeing Jesus not as a coequal God but as the divine *Messenger* who faithfully reveals and carries out the one true God’s will, embodying God’s wisdom for humanity.
