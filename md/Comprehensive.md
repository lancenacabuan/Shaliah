# Biblical Unitarianism: Jesus as God’s Human Agent and Embodied Wisdom

The **Biblical Unitarian** perspective insists that traditional Trinitarian doctrine misreads Scripture by conflating Jesus with the infinite God.  Instead, Jesus is understood as God’s uniquely appointed messenger – His *shaliah* (Hebrew for “sent one” or agent) – not God in essence.  In this view, whenever Jesus is called “God” or given divine titles, it is in the representative sense: as the authorized emissary in whom God’s purpose and power are revealed.  This principle of agency (shaliah) is well attested in Jewish law and tradition.  As one source explains, the Jewish legal maxim is that *“a person’s agent is regarded as the person himself”*.  Thus any act or word of the agent is counted as if done by the principal.  Under this principle an agent may “carry out divine functions” and even be spoken of with divine language, without literally being the divine principal.  Jesus, according to this view, was indeed God’s *ultimate* agent – “the very image of God and therefore God’s ultimate communication of Himself” – but he is not God Himself in his being.

This *shaliah* concept appears throughout the Old Testament.  God often *sent* prophets or angels as His agents and these agents could speak or act as if they were the Lord.  For example, when Hagar encounters the Angel of the LORD in Genesis 16, she addresses him as “the God who sees me,” saying “Truly here I have seen the God who sees me”, even though the narrative calls the visitor “the angel of the LORD.”  Similarly, Jacob wrestles with “a man” but later calls him God, until Hosea clarifies that Jacob had actually wrestled with an angel of the LORD (Hosea 12:3–4).  In each case, the angelic messenger is portrayed as making God’s presence manifest and is identified with God in speech, yet the text carefully maintains the agent’s distinct identity.  These and many other examples (e.g. the “angel of the LORD” in Sodom and many appearances in Judges and Exodus) show that in biblical usage a divine messenger could legitimately be called “God” or “Lord” while acting under commission.  As one commentary notes, making the “leap from ‘a messenger for God’ to being ‘God – the pre-incarnate Jesus’ requires clear evidence which simply does not exist. The concept of agency explains the records more than adequately”.

In the New Testament, Jesus fits this pattern of divine agency perfectly.  He repeatedly emphasizes that he was *sent* by the Father and that he only did the Father’s work.  He says, “the Son does nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing” (John 5:19), and “for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me” (John 6:38).  Jesus’s entire ministry – his teaching, miracles and sacrificial death – reflects God’s power at work through him.  As one Unitarian writer summarizes, Jesus claimed “to act in God’s stead, to speak with authority received directly from God the Father,” such that his miracles and words “speak of his unique and complete manifestation of God in the human sphere.”  Even so, “it is clear that he is not God Himself, if only because he is God’s ultimate agent”.  In other words, Jesus is *like* God in function and representation, but the distinction between God (the sender) and Jesus (the sent) is maintained.

## Reinterpreting Christological Passages: Agency and Wisdom

Many passages traditionally cited for Christ’s deity take on new meanings when seen through the lens of agency and wisdom.  For example, John 10:30 – “I and the Father are one” – is often taken to assert ontological equality.  But under the shaliah principle it fits the idiom of unity of purpose.  The same Greek phrase (hen emeis) appears in 1 Corinthians 3:8, where “he who plants and he who waters are *one*”; Paul and Apollos cooperate for one purpose, yet no one claims they are one being.  Thus the context of John 10:30 (Jesus protecting his “sheep” with the Father’s power) makes clear “I and the Father have one purpose”.  John’s own prayer in chapter 17 likewise shows Jesus asking that believers be “one” in purpose, not substance (as he and the Father were “one” in purpose).

Similarly, when Thomas cries “My Lord and my God!” at the empty tomb (John 20:28), Unitarians note the flexibility of theos (“God”) in Greek.  In that culture it could honor someone as divine agent (even Roman rulers or angels could be called theos).  Trinitarians take Thomas’s words as direct worship of Jesus, but others understand it differently: either “my god” refers to the Father who raised Jesus, or at least uses theos in a subordinate sense.  Trinitarian Michaelis himself admitted that Thomas’s burst of astonishment could be “figurative,” meaning something like “whom I shall ever reverence in the highest degree,” rather than a doctrinal statement of Christ’s deity.  Moreover, as the context makes plain, Thomas was overwhelmed to realize *God* had raised Jesus from the dead, and proclaiming “my Lord and my God” expresses his recognition of Jesus’ vindicated authority.  It is arguably incredible that the disciples (who had just fled during Jesus’ arrest) suddenly hatched a mature doctrine of Trinity on the spot; more natural is that Thomas simply affirmed Jesus as his risen Lord under God.

A pivotal example is John 8:58, where Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am.”  Trinitarians see this as Jesus invoking the divine name (“I am” of Exodus 3:14).  But in Greek Jesus uses the simple *egō eimi* (“I am”) without predicate, an idiom meaning “It is I” or “I am he.”  (For instance, the blind man at John 9:9 likewise says *egō eimi* and the disciples in Matthew 26 answer “Not I” with egō eimi.)  As C. K. Barrett observes, *“Ego eimi \[‘I am’] does not identify Jesus with God, but it does draw attention to him in the strongest possible terms: ‘I am the one—the one you must look at…if you would know God.’”*.  In fact Jesus never says the full divine title (“I am who I am”) here.  If John had meant to cite Yahweh’s name (ὁ ὤν, “the One who is”), he would not have used *egō eimi* alone.  The Unitarian conclusion is that Jesus was simply affirming his identity as the promised Messiah (“I am he”), not declaring ontological equality with the Father.

Philippians 2:6–7 is another key text: “Who, though he was in the form (*morphē*) of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.”  Trinitarians take this to mean Jesus had God’s divine nature (“inner essence”).  But careful lexical and contextual study shows *morphē* in Greek most often means *“form” or “outward appearance”*.  As respected lexicons and biblical usage indicate, *morphē* refers to visible shape or appearance (e.g. “in a different form (*morphē*)” Jesus appeared on the Emmaus road, or idols made “in the form (*morphē*) of a man” in Isaiah).  The idea of “form” as ontology is not required by the text or Greek usage.  Understood this way, Philippians 2 means Jesus “existed in the form \[appearance] of God”—that is, in the appearance of holiness or divine authority—but he did not cling to that status.  He humbled himself in obedience and took on human likeness (verse 7), demonstrating the self-giving character of God’s servant, not relinquishing a supposed ontological status.

Similarly, in Colossians 1:15–17 Christ is called “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,” and “by him all things were created.”  Even here, the text distinguishes Jesus and God: he is the “image” (*eikon*) of God, not God Himself.  As the commentary notes, when something is the image of something else, “the ‘image’ and the ‘original’ are not the same thing”.  If Paul had meant “Christ is God,” he would simply have said so – but he carefully uses language of representation.  The text even parallels Christ to man, calling Adam God’s “image” elsewhere (Genesis 1:26).  In practice *eikon* always means likeness or representation in the NT (coins, idols, believers “being transformed into Christ’s image” (2 Cor. 3:18)).  So Colossians affirms Christ as the visible representative of the invisible God.  And the phrases about creation (“all things created by him”) must be understood in context: Paul’s immediate context is Christ as head of the Church (v.18) and new creation.  Biblical figures of speech show “all things were created” can be circumscribed.  One study points out that Paul uses an **inclusio** framing *all things* around a list of heavenly *“thrones…powers…rulers and authorities”*, suggesting he means “all things *necessary* for Christ’s Church”.  The emphasis is on Christ’s supremacy and God’s fullness dwelling in him (vv.18–19), not on literal cosmic creation.  Even when Colossians 1:17 says “he is before all things,” Paul explains that *“before”* (Greek *pro*) often implies rank or priority, not chronology.  Indeed verse 18 calls Christ the “firstborn from the dead,” establishing that “before” can simply mean “preeminent in rank” (in this case over the Church and God’s new order).  Thus these high passages can be read coherently without surrendering monotheism.

A further interpretive key is **Wisdom Christology**.  Both Jewish and early Christian traditions link Jesus with God’s wisdom.  The New Testament itself speaks of Jesus as God’s wisdom: Paul explicitly calls Christ “the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).  This echoes Old Testament ideas where God’s creative and salvific plan is portrayed as divine Wisdom (Sophia, Chokmah) active in the world.  John’s Gospel also frames Jesus as the incarnate Logos – a term from Greek philosophy meaning God’s reason or self-expression.  Unitarian scholars note that *“logos”* in John 1:1 originally denoted God’s creative word or plan, not a second person; John Lightfoot said Christian tradition “fixed” *logos* to mean a divine person only later.  In this view the Logos is essentially God’s eternal wisdom/planning word made flesh in Jesus.  Thus when Scripture calls Jesus the Creator’s agent (e.g. Colossians 1:16) or “the image of God,” it can mean he embodies God’s wisdom and purpose in human form, accomplishing what God willed through him.

## Trinitarian Objections and Responses

Unitarian interpretations anticipate key objections.  For example, Trinitarians claim Judaism itself hints at plurality in Genesis (“Let us make man in our image” – Gen 1:26) or view Old Testament *echad* (“one”) in Deuteronomy 6:4 as a composite unity.  However, Hebrew *echad* is simply “one,” as Buzzard notes: it “does not imply compound unity,” and in every context it denotes single unity.  Ancient Jews “understood the Unity of God…in the most absolute and unqualified manner,” with no notion of multiple divine persons.  Indeed Jesus himself affirmed the Shema (“the Lord our God is one” – Mark 12:29) to a Jewish audience, making it inconceivable that he would secretly teach a tritheistic doctrine while quoting that command.

Similarly, Trinitarians point to Church history (Nicene Council) as authoritative.  But historical context shows the Trinity doctrine emerged under post-biblical influence.  Even a fellow Unitarian source observes that *“early Church leaders…began to accept”* without biblical warrant the assumption that redemption required Christ to be “an uncreated being, part of an eternal godhead” – a view imported from Platonic/Gnostic thinking.  The claims that “God became man” were largely driven by the Hellenistic idea that only an infinite God could accomplish infinite salvation.  Yet the Bible itself calls Jesus a man appointed by God to save (e.g. Acts 17:31 – “God…will judge the world…by a man whom he has appointed”) and teaches that “there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim 2:5).  Any doctrine that obscures the historical Christ should be examined carefully.

In every case, a unitarian reading stresses coherence with Scripture’s own emphasis on God’s oneness and Jesus’ humanity.  When pressed, defenders of Unitarianism point to biblical evidence of God working through Jesus without making him a second God.  For example, Jesus repeatedly states that all judgment and granting of life come from the Father through him (John 5:22–23), not on his own.  His statement “I and the Father are one” must be read against that background: Jesus and God are one in *purpose*, not one substance.  Likewise, Acts 3:13 calls Jesus “God’s servant” who bore God’s name; Paul tells us we receive the “Spirit of Jesus” not to deify him but to honor him as Lord under God (1 Cor 12:3).  The resonant theme is that Jesus always defers to the Father, doing “nothing of himself”, and the Father endorses and raises him.  Thomas’s cry “My Lord and my God” thus fits a pattern of recognizing Jesus as the exalted Son of God, empowered by God – not declaring himself the Almighty.

## Rediscovering the Gospel and the True Mission of Jesus

Reframing Jesus as God’s sent agent deepens and clarifies the original Gospel message.  It returns focus to the biblical kernel: *God raised Jesus of Nazareth as His Messiah and Lord*, and those who trust in him in that sense are saved.  Paul anchored this Gospel in history: “if you confess with your mouth ‘Jesus is Lord’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Rom. 10:9).  Unitarian scholars emphasize that the resurrection attested Jesus as the victorious Messiah of God’s plan, not as the incarnation of an eternal second God.  The central proclamation of the apostles was that Jesus was *the* Christ (Messiah) chosen by God, whose obedience and sacrifice accomplished God’s will.  Indeed Acts 1:3 records that after his resurrection Jesus “presented himself alive by many convincing proofs” and *“spoke about the kingdom of God”*, underscoring that his message was God’s own plan for the world, not a secret doctrine about his own deity.

Understanding Jesus as the embodiment of God’s wisdom and commissioned agent highlights the theme of God’s sovereign will.  Jesus’ life and death were the climax of God’s purposeful “plan of the ages,” realized in a man humble enough to call himself God’s servant (Luke 22:27) and faithful enough to say, “not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).  In this view the “good news” is that the promised King has come in the flesh as a true human, fully empowered by God, to inaugurate God’s Kingdom (Romans 1:1–4).  It means salvation comes through faith in the risen Messiah – the one whom God authorized and glorified – rather than through belief in a mystical Trinity.

In sum, the Biblical Unitarian position seeks to recover the simple monotheistic faith of Scripture: worship the one Almighty God, and honor Jesus as His anointed Son and Messenger.  By correcting the understanding of Jesus’ identity – seeing him as man “appointed by God” and filled with God’s wisdom and Spirit – this view argues we also recover the original apostolic Gospel.  Jesus’ true mission, once clarified, becomes clearer: he was *the man of God’s choosing* who faithfully revealed God’s character and purposes.  The “true Gospel” is vindicated as the historical news that **God raised Jesus from the dead and exalted him as Lord**, opening the way of life to all who believe in the one true God through the Messiah He sent.  This understanding restores the message Christians proclaimed in the first century, without the later accretions of trinitarian metaphysics, and calls believers today back to faith in the God of Israel and His Anointed, Jesus Christ.
