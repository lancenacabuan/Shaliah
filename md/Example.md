The Jewish Scriptures present a rigorous model of divine agency in which a human or angelic envoy, though not ontologically identical with Yahweh, is empowered to speak and act with God’s own authority. In rabbinic terminology this is the shaliah principle, a legal-theoretical paradigm stating that “the sender (shaliah) and the one sent (shaliah al ha-shaliah)” are functionally indistinguishable in executing the sender’s will. Moses, commissioned at the burning bush, declares “the LORD said to me . . .” (Exodus 3:15–17) while subsequently the text refers to Moses himself in the third person as “God” to Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1). Similarly, in Joshua 5:14–15 the commander of the LORD’s host calls himself “the captain of the host of the LORD” yet speaks as the LORD’s envoy rather than a second deity. The decree of Zechariah 3:1–7 portrays Joshua the high priest clothed “with the clean garments”—that is, God’s own righteousness—while still distinct from the LORD he serves. These and countless other narratives (cf. 1 Samuel 2:10; Psalm 82:6) establish a biblical precedent for an agent who, though granted divine titles or called “god” in a functional sense, remains strictly subordinate to the one true God.

When we turn to the New Testament, we observe that early Jewish believers appropriated this agency framework to understand the Messiah. Jesus’ appellation as “Son of Man” (Daniel 7:13–14) echoes an exalted heavenly figure who receives “dominion, glory, and a kingdom” from the Ancient of Days, yet remains a vice-regent rather than co-equal with God. Likewise, in John 17:3 Jesus pleads with the Father, “This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent,” implying that Jesus’ sent-status is ontologically distinct from the Father. The apostolic witness consistently emphasizes Jesus’ dependence on the Father (John 5:19–23; 1 Corinthians 11:3) and confines divine identity strictly to the God of Israel (James 2:19), all while ascribing to Jesus a unique mediatorial role that justifies exclusive obedience and worship.

Parallel to the Shaliah motif, the Old Testament enshrines “Wisdom” as a personified yet created attribute of God—eternal in God’s counsels but only made manifest at creation. Proverbs 8 portrays Wisdom as present “when he established the heavens” and as “a master workman” at the cosmic forge, yet Wisdom speaks and acts on God’s behalf rather than as a separate deity. In Hellenistic Judaism, Philo of Alexandria develops this Logos-Wisdom motif, framing the Word as a functional instrument of creation and revelation. Early Christian writers, especially Paul, adopt this Wisdom Christology to articulate Jesus not as an independent hypostasis existing since eternity but as God’s pre-appointed instrument—the divine Logos enfleshed—through whom all things were created (1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:15–17).

Traditional Trinitarianism locates passages such as John 1:1 (“the Word was God”), Hebrews 1:3 (“the radiance of his glory and the exact imprint of his nature”), and Philippians 2:6 (“though he was in the form of God”) as proof of Jesus’ ontological co-equality and co-eternity with the Father. However, within a Wisdom and agency framework, “the Word was God” can be read as “the Word was a divine instrument,” much like the temple pillars Jachin and Boaz, which were named “because he establishes” and “because he in strength” but remained symbolic. Hebrews’ language of “exact imprint” (charakter) underscores representation, not identity; a seal bears the exact form of a king’s signet yet is not the king himself. Philippians’ “form of God” (morphe theou) denotes functional likeness—that Jesus perfectly exemplified God’s character—without implying shared substance. Thus, words of divine prerogative in the New Testament, including “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30), reflect unity of purpose and mission rather than collapsed personal distinctions.

No examination of this model would be complete without addressing Pauline and Johannine passages where Jesus receives worship, forgives sins, and exercises prerogatives reserved for God in the Old Testament. Critics argue that if Jesus is mere agent, divine worship is misdirected. Yet within the biblical economy, worship of an agent is not inherently idolatrous when the agent functions as God’s designated representative—as when the cherubim or the temple itself become loci of divine presence (Exodus 25:22; Ezekiel 10). Jesus authorizes worship precisely because he embodies God’s will; to refuse him is to refuse the Father (Matthew 10:40). Forgiveness of sins (Mark 2:5–12) is likewise rooted in Jesus’ unique appointment as mediator of the new covenant, fulfilling Jeremiah 31:34’s promise that God “will forgive their iniquity,” enacted through his once-for-all sacrifice (Hebrews 8:7–13).

Anticipating further objections, one might cite Revelation 22:13 (“I am the Alpha and the Omega”) to assert eternal deity. Yet apocalyptic literature is rife with metaphorical identifications: Wisdom in Sirach claims “‘I am he . . . from everlasting” yet is clearly a facet of God, not a distinct divine person. Doctrinally, the church’s later creedal formulations emerged within a milieu of Greco-Roman philosophical debates over substance and hypostasis, terms unknown to the biblical authors. While the early church fathers often defended what they called “the deity of Christ,” their philosophical vocabulary imported Platonic categories that reshaped and arguably obscured the Hebraic understanding of agency and embodiment of divine wisdom.

Rediscovering Jesus as God’s anointed agent and the living Wisdom of the Creator restores the simplicity and radical monotheism of the apostolic gospel. The true gospel proclaims a single transcendent God who, in the fullness of time, sent his Son—not to reveal another god but to personify and actualize his eternal counsel in history, to suffer and die on behalf of sinful humanity, and to inaugurate the sacred, Spirit-empowered community called to bear witness to God’s reign. This corrected view transforms our worship, our doctrine, and our mission: we worship the Father in the Son by the Spirit, proclaiming one God and entrusting ourselves wholly to the one whom God has sent.

Understanding Jesus in light of the Jewish Shaliah principle and Wisdom Christology does not diminish his glory but magnifies the Father’s singular sovereignty and the grandeur of God’s design. By recognizing Jesus as the perfect agent, we reembrace the authentic biblical narrative, seeing in him the climax of Israel’s hope, the embodiment of divine wisdom, and the faithful envoy whose one-way mission invites all nations into covenantal fellowship with the one true God.
