# Church-Traditional Trinitarianism vs. The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Cultural Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency  

---

## **Abstract**

This dissertation explores the theological divergence between **Church-Traditional Trinitarianism** and the **Biblical Unitarian** view of Jesus Christ, focusing specifically on their respective interpretations of Jesus within the frameworks of **Hebrew Wisdom Literature** and the **Jewish Law of Agency (Shaliah)**. While Trinitarianism holds that Jesus is the eternal, preexistent Second Person of the Trinity, coequal with the Father, Biblical Unitarianism affirms that Jesus is the uniquely begotten human Messiah, exalted by God but not ontologically divine.

By examining key biblical texts—such as John 1, Philippians 2, Colossians 1, and Hebrews 1—this study analyzes how each model interprets themes of preexistence, creation, and divine representation. It further evaluates the literary personification of Wisdom in Jewish tradition, showing that these texts do not suggest a literal, preexistent being but rather poetic expressions of God’s own attributes. The Jewish law of agency is presented as a historically grounded framework that clarifies Jesus’ authority as God's representative without implying shared essence.

The findings suggest that the **Biblical Unitarian model offers greater consistency with Second Temple Jewish monotheism, the literary and theological patterns of Scripture, and Jesus’ own self-description**. It maintains the Father as the one true God while honoring Jesus as the fully authorized, glorified Messiah. The study concludes that **Biblical Unitarian Christology provides a coherent, historically rooted, and theologically faithful alternative** to traditional Trinitarianism.

## **Chapter 1: Historical Development of Trinitarian Christology**

The doctrine of the Trinity, as understood in historic orthodoxy, did not emerge fully formed in the earliest days of the Church. Rather, it developed over several centuries, shaped by a combination of scriptural interpretation, philosophical influence, theological necessity, and ecclesiastical conflict. This chapter explores the formation of Trinitarian Christology within its historical context, assessing how the church came to affirm that Jesus Christ is consubstantial with the Father, eternally preexistent, and fully divine. It also raises the critical question: Did this theological trajectory remain faithful to the monotheistic foundation of Second Temple Judaism, or did it adopt categories foreign to the biblical worldview?

---

### **1.1 The Jewish Roots of Early Christian Monotheism**

The earliest Christians were Jews, deeply rooted in the monotheistic framework of the Shema: *“Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!”* (Deut 6:4). For them, there was no division within the Godhead; God was one person, not a plurality of persons sharing a single essence. This foundational truth shaped their understanding of God's actions in creation, redemption, and revelation.

Jesus’ own statements, such as *“My Father is greater than I”* (John 14:28) and *“This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent”* (John 17:3), reflect a clear distinction between Himself and God. Early preaching in Acts likewise maintained this monotheistic clarity: *“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles...”* (Acts 2:22). These proclamations speak of Jesus as God's agent, not God Himself.

---

### **1.2 The Emergence of Logos Theology**

As Christianity spread into the Gentile world, engagement with Greco-Roman thought became more common. One of the key philosophical influences was **Middle Platonism**, particularly as developed by Philo of Alexandria, a Jewish philosopher who used the term *Logos* to describe a mediating principle between God and the world. For Philo, the *Logos* was not God Himself, but God's rational expression—an intermediary being or force.

Early Christian thinkers, notably Justin Martyr, began to apply this concept to Jesus. In his *Dialogue with Trypho*, Justin identifies Jesus as the *pre-existent Logos*, generated from the Father before creation. Though still subordinated to the Father in some respects, this Logos was increasingly seen as divine in essence. This laid the foundation for **Logos Christology**, where Jesus is portrayed as the preexistent divine Word who became incarnate (cf. John 1:1–14).

---

### **1.3 The Road to Nicaea: Doctrinal Crystallization**

The third and fourth centuries saw intensifying debates about Jesus' nature, particularly in relation to the Father. **Arius**, a presbyter from Alexandria, argued that Jesus, though exalted, was a created being—*“there was a time when he was not.”* This position, though reflecting certain subordinationist elements present in earlier theology, was seen as a threat to Christ’s divinity.

In response, the **Council of Nicaea** (AD 325) affirmed that the Son is *homoousios*—“of the same substance” as the Father. The Nicene Creed declared Jesus to be *“God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God.”* This language marked a sharp turn from Jewish monotheism into ontological formulations using Greek metaphysics. The **Council of Constantinople** (AD 381) further solidified Trinitarianism by formalizing the divinity of the Holy Spirit, thus completing the threefold formula.

---

### **1.4 Post-Nicene Developments and Institutional Enforcement**

Following the councils, Trinitarianism became not only a theological conviction but also an imperial orthodoxy. Dissenters—whether Arian, Modalist, or Unitarian—were often marginalized or persecuted. The works of **Athanasius**, **Cappadocian Fathers**, and **Augustine** further refined Trinitarian thought, increasingly embedding philosophical speculation into Christian theology.

Yet, these formulations came at a cost. In many respects, they departed from the language and categories of Scripture. Instead of viewing Jesus as the Messiah who represented God with delegated authority (as seen in the Gospels and Acts), the Church increasingly viewed Him as a divine being sharing an eternal, undivided essence with the Father.

---

### **Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity**

The doctrine of the Trinity, though now considered central to mainstream Christianity, developed incrementally and contentiously. While Trinitarian Christology emerged in part as a defense of Jesus’ exalted status, it also relied heavily on philosophical categories foreign to Jewish thought. This raises the question: Was the early Jewish understanding of Jesus as God’s anointed representative overwritten by Hellenistic theology? The following chapters will explore whether **Biblical Unitarianism**, rooted in Jewish frameworks such as wisdom literature and agency law, better preserves the biblical witness to Jesus’ identity.

---

## **Chapter 2: The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus**

### **2.1 Defining Biblical Unitarianism**

Biblical Unitarianism is a theological framework that affirms the **absolute oneness of God**—the Father—and denies the **ontological deity of Jesus Christ**. It holds that Jesus is the **prophesied Messiah**, uniquely begotten, miraculously conceived, and glorified by God, but **not equal to God** in nature, essence, or eternity. This view stands in contrast to Trinitarianism, not primarily as a rejection of Christ's exalted role, but as a commitment to **Scriptural monotheism** as defined by the Shema (Deut 6:4) and reinforced throughout both Testaments.

Rather than interpreting the New Testament through post-biblical metaphysical concepts, Biblical Unitarians seek to read Christology in continuity with **Second Temple Jewish monotheism**, wherein God is a single person—**YHWH, the Father**. Jesus is understood as the divinely authorized human representative of God, whose mission is rooted in Hebrew prophecy and fulfilled in obedient sonship.

---

### **2.2 Scriptural Foundations for Unitarian Christology**

Biblical Unitarianism rests firmly on a number of straightforward scriptural affirmations:

* **Deuteronomy 6:4** – *“Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!”*
  This is the foundational monotheistic confession in all of Scripture. It affirms that **God is one person**, not three in one essence.

* **John 17:3** – *“This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”*
  Jesus, in prayer to the Father, identifies the Father alone as **“the only true God”**, excluding Himself from that category while distinguishing His own sent status.

* **1 Timothy 2:5** – *“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”*
  This verse explicitly separates **God** from **the man Christ Jesus**, identifying Jesus not as God Himself but as the **appointed mediator** between God and humanity.

* **Acts 2:22** – *“Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst...”*
  Peter’s proclamation after Pentecost describes Jesus as **a man through whom God worked**, not as God incarnate.

These and many other verses consistently portray Jesus as the **Son of God**, not God the Son. His authority, power, and glory are derived from the Father, not coequal or coeternal with Him.

---

### **2.3 Jesus as the Son of God, Not God the Son**

In Biblical Unitarian theology, **"Son of God"** is a **title of status**, not essence. It refers to one who has a unique relationship with God, especially the Davidic Messiah who would rule in God's name. Scriptural precedent supports this:

* **Psalm 2:7** – *“You are My Son, today I have begotten You.”*
  This verse, quoted in Hebrews 1:5, suggests that Jesus’ sonship is not eternal but **began at a point in time**—namely His conception, resurrection, or enthronement.

* **Luke 1:35** – *“The Holy Spirit will come upon you... and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.”*
  The angel explains that Jesus is called the Son of God **because** of His miraculous conception—not because of eternal preexistence.

Jesus is never called “God the Son” in Scripture. Such terminology reflects **later theological development**, not biblical language. Unitarians point out that when the New Testament refers to “God,” it almost always means **the Father**—not a composite Trinity.

---

### **2.4 Responses to Trinitarian Prooftexts**

Biblical Unitarians do not ignore passages used in support of Trinitarian doctrine but interpret them differently:

* **John 1:1** – Rather than asserting the preexistence of a second divine person, Unitarians argue that “the Word” (*logos*) is not a person but **God’s self-expression, plan, or wisdom**. When John 1:14 says the Word “became flesh,” it refers to the embodiment of that divine plan in Jesus—not a divine person transforming into a human.

* **Philippians 2:5–11** – Rather than describing preexistence, this passage highlights Jesus’ **mindset of humility**, beginning with his human life. “Existing in the form of God” may mean acting as God’s representative, not having divine essence.

* **Colossians 1:15–20** – Jesus is the “firstborn of all creation,” not because He preexisted creation, but because He holds supremacy in the **new creation** inaugurated through His resurrection. The language is functional and redemptive, not ontological.

---

### **2.5 Historical Presence of Unitarian Views**

While marginalized after the councils of the 4th century, **Unitarian Christologies** were not invented in modernity. Subordinationist views—where Christ is exalted but not coequal—were common in **early Christian writings**, including the works of the **Apostolic Fathers**, **Justin Martyr**, and even **Origen**, who acknowledged a hierarchy within the divine order.

Later groups such as the **Paulicians**, **Socinians**, and **Biblical Unitarians** (e.g., 16th–18th century reformers) revived and maintained the view of Christ as **God’s uniquely begotten man**. These groups often appealed directly to Scripture and the Jewish context of Jesus' identity, pushing back against creedal formulations they viewed as unscriptural.

---

### **Jesus as the Exalted Human Messiah**

Biblical Unitarianism offers a coherent Christology rooted in the **explicit language of Scripture**, the **monotheistic worldview of ancient Judaism**, and the **agency-based understanding** of Jesus' mission. It preserves God’s singular identity while honoring the Son’s obedience, death, resurrection, and exaltation. Rather than reducing Jesus’ role, it clarifies the distinction between God and His anointed servant—a theme consistent with the Hebrew Bible and the teachings of Jesus Himself.

As we proceed to **Chapter 3**, we will explore how **Hebrew Wisdom Literature** has influenced New Testament Christology and examine whether personified wisdom concepts demand a Trinitarian reading—or if they support a more **figurative and representational** understanding aligned with Unitarian thought.

---

## **Chapter 3: Wisdom Literature and Its Christological Echoes**

### **3.1 Introduction to Wisdom Literature and Personification**

Within the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly in Proverbs, Job, and intertestamental writings such as Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon, **Wisdom (Hebrew: *ḥokmah*, Greek: *sophia*)** is portrayed as a living, active, almost personal agent through whom God creates, teaches, and governs. This literary personification—Wisdom calling, walking in the streets, speaking in the first person—has long intrigued interpreters, especially in the light of New Testament passages that appear to echo or repurpose this imagery for Christ.

Trinitarian theology often draws upon this **Wisdom Christology** to support the idea of Christ’s eternal preexistence and divine nature. However, a close literary and contextual reading of both Hebrew and Greek Jewish wisdom texts suggests that **Wisdom is not a distinct, ontological person**, but rather **a poetic embodiment of God’s own attributes and purposes**. Biblical Unitarianism contends that New Testament writers, especially Paul and John, do not identify Jesus as pre-existent Wisdom itself, but as **the human embodiment of divine wisdom** in mission and message.

---

### **3.2 Wisdom as God’s Attribute, Not a Distinct Person**

In **Proverbs 8**, Wisdom is portrayed as present “from the beginning,” rejoicing before God and assisting in creation:

> *“The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, before His works of old... When He established the heavens, I was there...”* (Prov 8:22–27)

Some interpret this passage as a veiled reference to Christ, particularly given the language of being “brought forth” and “beside” God. But in context, **Wisdom is a poetic personification**—not a distinct hypostasis. Proverbs 1–9 uses female imagery and metaphor to contrast **Lady Wisdom** with **Lady Folly**. The reader is invited to “love her” and “listen to her,” just as they would obey God’s instruction. This was never intended as an ontological statement about a second divine being.

Further evidence lies in the Jewish intertestamental literature:

* **Sirach 24:3** – *“I came forth from the mouth of the Most High...”*
* **Wisdom of Solomon 7:22–28** – *“For wisdom is more mobile than any motion... she is a reflection of eternal light...”*

These writings further personify wisdom but never suggest that **Wisdom is a second divine person**. Rather, wisdom functions as a literary and theological **bridge between God and creation**, not as an independent being. In all these texts, Wisdom remains an **attribute of God**, poetically illustrated, not an eternal divine Son.

---

### **3.3 New Testament Echoes: Christ as the Agent of Wisdom**

In the New Testament, several passages reflect themes and language reminiscent of Jewish wisdom traditions:

* **Colossians 1:15–17** – *“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created...”*
* **Hebrews 1:1–3** – *“He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature...”*
* **John 1:1–14** – *“In the beginning was the Word (Logos)... And the Word became flesh...”*

These verses have been interpreted as affirming Christ’s **preexistence** and participation in creation. Yet, the Biblical Unitarian reading argues that these passages employ **wisdom motifs metaphorically or representationally**, not literally.

For example, **Colossians 1** may be better understood in terms of **Christ’s role in the new creation** rather than the original Genesis creation. The phrase “all things” may refer to **authorities and powers** (v. 16) being restructured around the risen Christ, not a claim about Him existing before the world. Likewise, **Hebrews 1** describes Jesus **as the ultimate revelation of God’s character**—not as an eternal being who participated in creation as a second divine person, but as the **appointed Son** who inherits all things (v. 2).

Even **John 1**, often cited as the strongest Trinitarian evidence, uses the term *Logos*, not “Son,” until verse 14. Biblical Unitarians suggest that *logos* here refers not to a person, but to **God’s wisdom, plan, or purpose**—impersonal until it became embodied in the man Jesus. This reading allows us to understand Christ as **the fulfillment of God's word**, not the eternal Logos personified in Greek philosophy.

---

### **3.4 Wisdom Embodied, Not Preexistent**

Biblical Unitarianism affirms that Jesus **embodied** divine wisdom during His life and ministry. This view aligns with **Luke 2:40**:

> *“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom...”*

If Jesus were literally divine Wisdom incarnate, it would be incoherent to say He increased in wisdom. Instead, we are seeing a **genuinely human development**, where Jesus grew in His awareness, understanding, and obedience—just as a human prophet or servant of God would.

Jesus’ parables, teachings, and life choices reflect the deepest expressions of divine wisdom. In this way, He did not preexist as Wisdom itself but **became the living embodiment of God’s wisdom**—God’s perfect Word expressed in human form. This reading preserves His human nature and consistent alignment with Israel’s monotheism.

---

### **Jesus as the Embodied Divine Wisdom**

While Trinitarianism often leans on Wisdom literature to support a preexistent Christ, a contextual and literary reading of these texts suggests otherwise. **Wisdom is consistently portrayed as a poetic personification of God’s attributes**, not as a literal person or divine being. New Testament writers, steeped in Jewish thought, utilize Wisdom motifs not to teach a dual-person Godhead, but to portray Jesus as **the fully authorized, spirit-filled human Messiah**, in whom God’s Wisdom is most perfectly seen.

This prepares us for the next step in our investigation—**Chapter 4: The Jewish Law of Agency**, where we will examine how Jesus' words, authority, and actions are best understood through the legal and cultural lens of the **Shaliah**, the sent one who represents the sender fully, without being ontologically identical to the sender.

---

## **Chapter 4: The Jewish Law of Agency (Shaliah)**

### **4.1 Understanding Shaliah: A Foundational Jewish Legal Principle**

In Jewish law and tradition, the concept of **agency** (*Shaliah* in Hebrew) is foundational to both religious and civil life. The principle is summarized in the rabbinic maxim:

> *“The agent is as the one who sent him”* (Hebrew: *shlucho shel adam k’moto*) — Mishnah Berakhot 5:5.

A **Shaliah** is a fully authorized representative acting on behalf of another, often empowered to carry out legal or covenantal matters. Importantly, the agent is **not ontologically identical** to the sender but is **functionally representative**, meaning he speaks and acts with the sender’s authority as if the sender himself were present.

This legal-cultural norm formed a key part of the **Second Temple Jewish worldview**. It influenced how Jewish people understood prophetic authority, priestly roles, angelic messages, and, as this chapter will demonstrate, the role of **the Messiah**. The law of agency provides a powerful interpretive framework for understanding Jesus’ authority, words, and works without requiring Him to be God Himself in essence.

---

### **4.2 Agency in the Hebrew Bible and Jewish Tradition**

The Old Testament frequently employs the law of agency. Agents of God—whether human or angelic—often act, speak, and are addressed as if they were God Himself. Yet they remain **creatures, not the Creator**.

#### **Moses as “God” to Pharaoh and Aaron**

In **Exodus 4:16**, God tells Moses regarding Aaron:

> *“He shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as God to him.”*

And again in **Exodus 7:1**:

> *“See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.”*

Moses is not divine, but he **functions as God's agent**, exercising His authority on earth. The language of divinity applied to Moses does not imply essence, but **representation**.

#### **Human Judges and Kings Called “gods”**

Psalm 82 refers to unjust human judges:

> *“I said, ‘You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.’ Nevertheless you will die like men...”* (Ps 82:6–7)

These “gods” (*elohim*) were mortal rulers entrusted with administering divine justice. Their divine title reflects **delegated authority**, not divine nature. The same applies to the Davidic king in Psalm 45:

> *“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever...”* (Ps 45:6)

Yet the next verse clarifies:

> *“Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You...”* (Ps 45:7)

Even the one called “God” has a God over him—underscoring **representational status**.

#### **Angels and the Angel of the LORD**

Angels often act on God's behalf and speak in His voice:

* In **Genesis 22:11–12**, the angel of the LORD says, *“You have not withheld your son... from Me.”*
* In **Exodus 3:2–6**, the angel in the burning bush declares, *“I am the God of your father.”*

These examples reflect a **known literary and theological pattern**: the **agent speaks as the sender**, and the **authority of God is manifested through His messengers**, without confusing their identity with His.

---

### **4.3 Jesus as the Supreme Agent of God**

Against this rich background of agency, Jesus’ words in the Gospels become clear:

* *“I can do nothing on My own initiative... I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”* (John 5:30)
* *“My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.”* (John 7:16)
* *“He who has seen Me has seen the Father.”* (John 14:9)

These are **agency claims**, not assertions of ontological unity. Jesus functions as the *shaliah* of God par excellence—**sanctified, sent, obedient**, and **invested with divine authority**. His authority stems from His commissioning (*John 10:36*), not from innate divinity.

---

### **4.4 Jesus’ Defense in John 10: Quoting Psalm 82**

When accused of blasphemy in **John 10:33** for claiming to be the Son of God, Jesus responds:

> *“Has it not been written in your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’? If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came... do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?”* (John 10:34–36)

Jesus does not assert equality with God; He appeals to **Scriptural precedent**. If **human judges** could be called “gods” due to their representative role, **how much more fitting** is it for **Him**, whom the Father sanctified and sent, to be called **Son of God**?

This argument aligns perfectly with the **agency model**—Jesus is not claiming deity, but **divine commissioning** and authority.

---

### **4.5 Apostolic Continuation of Agency**

After His resurrection, Jesus extends His agency model to His disciples:

> *“As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”* (John 20:21)

Just as Jesus was **not the Father** but **represented Him**, so the apostles are not Jesus but **represent Him**. This **chain of agency** maintains a clear distinction of persons while preserving unity in mission and message.

---

### **4.6 Agency vs. Ontological Trinitarianism**

Trinitarian theology interprets Jesus’ unity with the Father as ontological (shared being). But in Second Temple Judaism, **functional unity through agency** was already well established. Understood this way, Jesus’ statements—*“I and the Father are one”* (John 10:30), or *“He who has seen Me has seen the Father”* (John 14:9)—become powerful affirmations of **representational fidelity**, not metaphysical identity.

---

### **Jesus as the Faithful Divine Agent**

The Jewish law of agency provides a compelling and coherent framework for understanding Jesus’ unique relationship to God. Like Moses, angels, and righteous kings before Him, Jesus bears divine authority because He is **sent**, **sanctified**, and **obedient**—not because He is **divine in essence**. But unlike any before Him, He is **perfect in His representation**, fully revealing God’s will, nature, and purpose. As the **faithful divine agent**, Jesus is worthy of all honor—**to the glory of the one true God, the Father**.

As we now move into **Chapter 5**, we will compare how both the Trinitarian and Unitarian models interpret major Christological texts. These case studies will further test whether **agency and wisdom** provide adequate tools for understanding the New Testament witness—or whether Trinitarian conclusions are exegetically necessary.

---

## **Chapter 5: Comparative Christological Analysis**

### **5.1 Purpose and Method**

Having laid the theological and historical groundwork for both Trinitarian and Biblical Unitarian Christologies, this chapter turns to **comparative exegesis**. The objective is to examine how each model interprets key New Testament passages that are often considered decisive for Christological claims—particularly regarding **preexistence**, **divinity**, and **relationship to the Father**.

The analysis focuses on four major texts:

* **John 1:1–14**
* **Philippians 2:5–11**
* **Colossians 1:15–20**
* **Hebrews 1:1–4**

Each passage will be examined in its literary context, then compared across both theological models, with attention to consistency with earlier Jewish frameworks such as **Wisdom literature** and the **law of agency**.

---

### **5.2 John 1:1–14 – The Word Made Flesh**

#### **Textual Overview**

> *“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us...”* (John 1:1,14)

#### **Trinitarian Interpretation**

Trinitarians read *“the Word”* (*logos*) as a preexistent, personal divine being—God the Son—eternally with the Father and fully divine. The incarnation in v.14 is viewed as a metaphysical descent: the eternal Second Person of the Trinity becoming human.

#### **Biblical Unitarian Interpretation**

Unitarians contend that *logos* in John 1:1 refers to **God’s spoken word, wisdom, or plan**—not a second person. The Greek grammar lacks a definite article before *theos* in *“the Word was God”*, often understood qualitatively: the Word was divine (not “God Himself”).

In this model, *“the Word became flesh”* means **God’s plan or expression was embodied in the man Jesus**, not that a preexistent being changed form. This aligns with **Psalm 33:6** (*“By the word of the Lord the heavens were made”*) and **Isaiah 55:11**, where God’s word goes out and accomplishes His will—impersonally.

---

### **5.3 Philippians 2:5–11 – The Humbling of Christ**

#### **Textual Overview**

> *“Although He existed in the form of God, \[He] did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself...”* (Phil 2:6–7)

#### **Trinitarian Interpretation**

This passage is seen as evidence of **preexistent divinity**. Jesus existed in the form of God and voluntarily took on humanity. His “emptying” (*kenosis*) is interpreted as a self-limiting act by a divine person.

#### **Biblical Unitarian Interpretation**

Unitarians read this text as describing **Jesus’ human mindset**, not preexistence. The Greek phrase *“form of God”* may mean **bearing divine authority or image** (cf. Adam), not divine essence. Jesus did not exploit His position but **humbled Himself** by obedience unto death—this humility is what leads to His **exaltation**, not a return to preexistent glory.

The key contrast is not between divine and human nature, but between **self-glorification** (like Adam or Caesar) and **obedient service**.

---

### **5.4 Colossians 1:15–20 – Firstborn of All Creation**

#### **Textual Overview**

> *“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created...”* (Col 1:15–16)

#### **Trinitarian Interpretation**

This passage is taken to mean that Christ existed before all created things and was active in their creation—implying **eternal preexistence and divine power**.

#### **Biblical Unitarian Interpretation**

Unitarians argue that *“firstborn”* (Greek: *prōtotokos*) implies **status and inheritance**, not literal preexistence. In Jewish thought, the firstborn was the **heir and ruler**, not necessarily the first to exist. Verse 16 is interpreted as referring to the **new creation**—all spiritual realities being restructured under Christ’s lordship post-resurrection.

Additionally, “in Him,” “through Him,” and “for Him” are **functional and covenantal**, not metaphysical claims. Christ is **the central figure of God’s redemptive plan**, not its metaphysical architect.

---

### **5.5 Hebrews 1:1–4 – God’s Son and Radiance**

#### **Textual Overview**

> *“...in these last days has spoken to us in His Son... through whom also He made the world. And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature...”* (Heb 1:2–3)

#### **Trinitarian Interpretation**

Hebrews 1 is read as affirming that Jesus is the **divine Son** through whom the cosmos was made, and who shares the **essence** (*hypostasis*) of God. The use of *“radiance”* and *“exact representation”* supports ontological equality.

#### **Biblical Unitarian Interpretation**

Unitarians interpret *“the ages”* or *“world”* (Greek: *aiōnas*) in v.2 not as the material cosmos, but as **God’s unfolding redemptive plan** (cf. Heb 11:3). Jesus is the one through whom God is now acting to inaugurate the **new age**.

“Radiance” is **representational**, not ontological. Jesus reflects God’s character as the obedient Son—not because He shares divine essence, but because He is **the perfect image-bearer**. The passage highlights appointment and inheritance, not eternal coexistence.

---

### **5.6 Comparative Summary**

| **Passage** | **Trinitarian View**                     | **Biblical Unitarian View**                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| John 1:1–14 | Preexistent Divine Logos incarnates      | God’s word/wisdom becomes embodied in Jesus      |
| Phil 2:5–11 | Divine Son humbles Himself into humanity | Human Messiah humbles Himself unto death         |
| Col 1:15–20 | Eternal Son, creator of all things       | Exalted Messiah over the new creation            |
| Heb 1:1–4   | Co-eternal divine Son, radiance of God   | Exalted human Son, perfect representative of God |

---

### **Jesus as the Interpreted Lord of Scripture**

The Trinitarian interpretation of these texts tends to read **preexistence and divinity into the passages**, often shaped by post-biblical philosophical categories. In contrast, the Biblical Unitarian reading stays rooted in **Hebrew literary patterns**, **Jewish monotheism**, and **functional representation**. The agency model and wisdom personification framework allow these texts to be understood in a way that **honors Jesus' exaltation without compromising the uniqueness of God**.

As we now turn to **Chapter 6**, we will assess the **broader theological implications** of both views—how each model affects worship, doctrine, and the lived faith of the believing community.

---

## **Chapter 6: Theological and Practical Implications**

### **6.1 Theology Shapes Worship**

The way we understand Jesus profoundly affects **how we worship God**. Trinitarianism directs worship toward a **triune being**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—three persons, yet one God. Songs, prayers, and liturgies are often offered *to Jesus as God*, alongside the Father.

In contrast, Biblical Unitarianism maintains the **exclusive worship of the Father as the one true God**, in accordance with Jesus’ own teaching (*John 4:23–24; John 17:3*). Jesus is **honored**, even highly exalted (*Phil 2:9–11*), but always **as Lord and Messiah**, never as YHWH Himself.

This distinction is not peripheral. For Unitarians, worshiping **Jesus as God** risks violating the first commandment (*Exod 20:3*) and the Shema (*Deut 6:4*), whereas Trinitarians argue that to deny Christ divinity is to diminish the fullness of His identity.

---

### **6.2 God’s Identity: Unity or Plurality?**

At the heart of the divide lies a fundamental theological question: **Who is God?**

* Trinitarians say: **One God in three persons**—Father, Son, and Spirit—all coequal and coeternal.
* Unitarians say: **One God, the Father only**, as Jesus Himself affirmed (*John 17:3*).

For Biblical Unitarians, the **Trinitarian model introduces unnecessary complexity** and relies on extra-biblical metaphysics that blur the identity of God. The agency model preserves God’s **ontological singularity** while allowing for Jesus’ unique status as His fully authorized and exalted human Son.

This issue impacts doctrinal clarity. The Trinitarian concept of **eternal generation** and **hypostatic union** (Jesus being fully God and fully man) often leads to doctrinal confusion, while the Unitarian model presents a **coherent and biblically-aligned narrative** of God’s relationship to His Son and to His people.

### **6.3 Soteriology: Who Saves Us and How?**

Trinitarian theology often ties salvation to the **divinity of Christ**—arguing that only God could bear the weight of human sin, and therefore, Christ must be fully divine to provide a sufficient atonement.

Biblical Unitarians affirm the **sufficiency of Christ’s atonement**, not because He was God, but because He was the **sinless, obedient Son of Man**, fully aligned with the will of God, who died as a **substitute** and was **vindicated** by resurrection. As Paul writes:

> *“By the righteousness of the One, the many will be made righteous”* (Rom 5:19)

This mirrors the pattern of Scripture where **God saves through His anointed one** (*Isaiah 53, Acts 5:30–31*), not by becoming that person Himself. Thus, salvation is **from God**, **through Christ**, and **by grace through faith**—without requiring Jesus to be ontologically God.

### **6.4 Christlikeness and Discipleship**

A Biblical Unitarian view sees Jesus not as a **God-man with inaccessible attributes**, but as **the perfect human example** of what it means to live in full obedience to God. His moral perfection, prayer life, suffering, and trust in the Father are genuinely **emulatable** because He was **one of us**:

> *“He had to be made like His brethren in all things...”* (Heb 2:17)

Trinitarianism, in contrast, sometimes presents Jesus as **two-natured**, which complicates how believers relate to Him as a model for human living. Was Jesus able to resist temptation because He was divine? Or because He was filled with the Spirit as a man? Biblical Unitarianism answers clearly: Jesus succeeded because of **faith, obedience, and God's empowering Spirit**, not innate divinity.

This human-centered view enhances discipleship by holding out Jesus as the **model of faith**, not merely the object of it.

### **6.5 Doctrinal Simplicity and Scriptural Clarity**

Biblical Unitarianism is often praised for its **doctrinal simplicity** and **scriptural directness**. It does not require reconciliation of paradoxes like “three in one” or “fully God and fully man.” Instead, it presents a theology that is:

* **Consistent with biblical monotheism**
* **Aligned with Jesus’ self-description**
* **Grounded in historical Jewish categories (e.g., Messiah, agency)**
* **Comprehensible without metaphysical speculation**

This simplicity strengthens personal and corporate understanding, reduces barriers in evangelism, and encourages faith built directly on **the words of Scripture**, not creeds.

### **Jesus as Our Human Model and Master**

The implications of how we understand Jesus extend far beyond abstract theology—they affect how we worship, whom we call God, how we relate to Christ, and how we live as His disciples. While Trinitarianism has dominated Church history, its complexity and philosophical framework challenge its biblical authenticity. Biblical Unitarianism offers a return to **the faith of Jesus and the apostles**, where the **one true God is the Father**, and Jesus is **His anointed human Son**, exalted as Lord but never confused with the God who sent Him.

With this foundation in place, we now proceed to the final chapter, where we will summarize the findings of this study and present a final evaluative conclusion.

## **Chapter 7: Conclusion**

### **7.1 Summary of Findings**

This dissertation has explored the doctrinal divergence between **Church-Traditional Trinitarianism** and **Biblical Unitarianism** in their respective understandings of Jesus Christ. Our aim has not been merely to contrast theological systems, but to evaluate them in the **context of Hebrew wisdom traditions**, the **Jewish law of agency**, and the **biblical witness** itself.

We began by tracing the **historical development of Trinitarian Christology**, noting how it arose gradually through philosophical and political developments, culminating in the ecumenical councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. These formulations, while seeking to protect the exalted status of Jesus, introduced **Hellenistic categories** foreign to the Hebrew worldview and the simple monotheism of Jesus and His apostles.

In contrast, **Biblical Unitarianism** remains rooted in the consistent testimony of Scripture—that the **Father alone is God**, and Jesus is the **appointed Messiah**, fully human yet fully authorized to act on God’s behalf. This model is not only textually coherent, but also contextually faithful to the Jewish framework of the Second Temple period.

Through examining key texts such as **John 1**, **Philippians 2**, **Colossians 1**, and **Hebrews 1**, we have seen that the **Trinitarian reading relies on assumptions of eternal preexistence and shared essence**, while the **Unitarian reading relies on representation, exaltation, and fulfillment**—categories organically present in biblical thought.

We also demonstrated that **Wisdom-Literature Christology** personifies divine attributes for rhetorical effect rather than depicting real, ontological persons. Jesus is the **embodiment** of God’s wisdom, not its metaphysical origin. Likewise, the **Jewish law of agency (Shaliah)** illuminates Jesus’ relationship to the Father: not as a coequal deity, but as the **divinely authorized representative** who speaks and acts for God without being God.

### **7.2 The Strengths of the Biblical Unitarian Model**

The Biblical Unitarian view upholds a number of vital strengths:

* **Doctrinal clarity**: It maintains the **oneness of God** as presented in both Testaments.
* **Textual fidelity**: It interprets Scripture in its own terms, not through post-biblical metaphysics.
* **Historical authenticity**: It aligns with the Jewish worldview from which Christianity emerged.
* **Ethical imitation**: It presents Jesus as a fully human example for faith and life.
* **Theological coherence**: It avoids paradoxes such as “three-in-one” or “fully God and fully man.”

It allows us to understand Jesus as the **second Adam**, the obedient servant, the risen Lord, and the exalted Son—without collapsing His identity into that of the one God.

### **7.3 The Way Forward for Biblical Christology**

Recovering a **biblically rooted, historically grounded Christology** is essential for the health of the global church. Rather than relying on inherited creeds or inherited complexities, the believing community is called to examine **the Scriptures afresh**—to ask not “What has the Church always said?” but “What do the Scriptures actually teach?”

This work has aimed to show that a **Biblical Unitarian Christology**, when rightly understood within the frameworks of **wisdom** and **agency**, offers a faithful alternative to traditional Trinitarianism. It does not deny Jesus’ glory but defines it in **Scriptural terms**:

> *“This Jesus God raised up again... Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”* (Acts 2:32, 36)

### **Jesus as Who He Truly Is**

In the end, the question is not whether we exalt Jesus highly enough, but whether we exalt Him as the Scriptures do—as **the Messiah**, **the Son of God**, and **the appointed Lord**, acting in perfect union with the will of the one true God, **the Father**. The Biblical Unitarian view calls us to **worship the Father through the Son**, just as Jesus Himself taught, and just as the earliest believers lived.
