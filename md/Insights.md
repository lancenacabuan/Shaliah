# Rediscovering the Authentic Jesus: A Call to Reformation through the Biblical Unitarian Lens

## Introduction: The Question That Changed History

For two millennia, no question has shaped the course of Christian theology more profoundly than this: **Who is Jesus of Nazareth?** The traditional answer, formulated in the fourth century, declares him to be the second person of a triune Godhead—"very God of very God." Yet this formulation, built on Hellenistic philosophical categories, departs significantly from the Jewish worldview of Jesus and the apostolic church.

This document invites a radical rediscovery—a return to the **authentic Jesus** of Scripture, seen not as God incarnate, but as **God's supreme human agent**, the Messiah, who perfectly embodied divine wisdom and fulfilled the redemptive purposes of his Father. Rooted in the **Shaliah (agency) principle** of Jewish law and **Wisdom Christology** from biblical and intertestamental literature, the Biblical Unitarian view restores the clarity, simplicity, and transformative power of the original gospel.

## 1. The Shaliah Principle: Understanding Jesus as God's Authorized Agent

In Jewish law, the principle is clear: *"A person’s agent is regarded as the person himself"* (Mishnah, Berakot 5:5; Kiddushin 41b). This concept of **Shaliah** governed daily life in the ancient Near East. When someone sent an agent, the agent acted with the sender's full authority—without being identical to the sender.

Jesus repeatedly refers to himself as "sent" by the Father. The Greek word *apostello* mirrors the Hebrew *shalach*, signaling Jesus's identity as **God's ultimate agent**. He says, "Whoever receives me receives him who sent me" (Matt 10:40). This principle explains how Jesus could speak and act with divine authority, even receiving reverence, while remaining distinct from God.

**Examples in Scripture:**

* **Moses**: "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh" (Ex. 7:1).
* **The Angel of the LORD**: Speaks as God yet is distinct from Him (e.g., Ex. 3:2-6).
* **Judges as "gods" (elohim)**: Psalm 82:6, cited by Jesus in John 10:34-36.

## 2. Wisdom Christology: Embodying God's Eternal Purpose

Jewish Wisdom literature (Proverbs 8, Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon) personifies **Wisdom** as God's creative and moral force. This was not a separate person but a **literary personification** of God’s eternal plan. Jesus, in the New Testament, is called "the wisdom of God" (1 Cor 1:24) and the one "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2:3).

**John 1:1**, often cited to prove Christ's deity, mirrors Wisdom literature. The *Logos* (Word) "was with God" and "was God" — that is, God's self-expressive plan. In John 1:14, this Logos "became flesh" in Jesus. The Word did not become a person; it became **a person**: Jesus, the embodiment of God's purpose.

## 3. Reinterpreting High Christology Passages

When viewed through agency and Wisdom Christology, difficult passages come into clearer focus:

* **Philippians 2:5-11**: Jesus, like Adam, faced the choice to grasp equality with God. He did not. Instead, he humbled himself, and God exalted him. This makes little sense if Jesus were already divine.

* **Colossians 1:15-20**: Jesus is the "image of the invisible God" and the one "through whom" all things were created—language that echoes the role of Wisdom in creation.

* **John 20:28 ("My Lord and my God")**: Thomas's statement follows the Jewish pattern of addressing God’s agents with divine titles (cf. Ex. 14:31: "they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses"). Jesus had just said, "I ascend to my God and your God" (John 20:17).

## 4. The Development of Trinitarian Doctrine: A Historical Detour

The idea of the Trinity is **absent** from the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. Early Christians like the Ebionites and later Arians affirmed Jesus's messiahship without equating him with God.

* The **Council of Nicaea (325 CE)** introduced *homoousios* (same substance), a term foreign to Scripture.
* The **Council of Constantinople (381 CE)** expanded this into full Trinitarianism.
* Influential thinkers like **Origen**, **Athanasius**, and **Augustine** relied heavily on **Greek metaphysics**, blending Scripture with **Platonism**.

Historical sources such as the *Encyclopedia Americana* admit that early Christianity was **Unitarian**, rooted in Judaism, and that Trinitarian doctrine was a **later philosophical deviation**.

## 5. The Gospel of the Kingdom: Jesus's Original Message

Jesus did not preach himself as God. He preached the **kingdom of God** (Mark 1:14-15) and called people to repentance, righteousness, and love of the one true God.

Peter's sermon at Pentecost proclaims: "Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested by God... God raised him up... Let all Israel know that God has made him both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:22-36).

Paul affirms this as well: "For us there is one God, the Father... and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things" (1 Cor. 8:6). **From** God; **through** Christ.

## 6. Responding to Objections

* **"Worship of Jesus"?** The Greek *proskuneo* includes acts of homage that don't imply divinity. Jesus receives worship as God's exalted agent, just as David or Moses did in their representative roles.

* **"Only God can forgive sins"?** Jesus said, "The Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (Matt 9:6) because God gave it to him. Later, the apostles were also given this authority (John 20:23).

* **"Before Abraham was, I am" (John 8:58)?** Jesus claims preeminence, not pre-existence—he embodies the eternal purpose of God, now revealed.

## 7. Implications for Faith and Practice

* **True Discipleship**: Jesus is the perfect human example, not a God pretending to be human. We are called to follow in his footsteps.
* **Restored Monotheism**: Worship the **one true God**, the Father, through Jesus as mediator (1 Tim 2:5).
* **Reunification with Jewish Roots**: Removes the major stumbling block between Christianity and Judaism.
* **Evangelistic Clarity**: Simplifies the gospel message: Jesus is the Messiah, raised and exalted by God.

## 8. A Call to Reformation

The Reformation sought to return to **Scripture alone**. Today, we need a new Reformation—one that re-centers on the **one God of Israel** and His **Messiah Jesus**.

Jesus prayed: "This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17:3).

Let us return to this simple, powerful gospel: **One God, one Lord, one Spirit, one hope.** Let us preach not a metaphysical mystery, but a risen man, exalted by God.

> **"Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God."** (Matt. 16:16)

This is the confession that changed the world. It still can.
