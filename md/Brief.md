An exhaustive inquiry into the person and work of Jesus Christ, when stripped of centuries of Hellenistic philosophical overlay and post-apostolic creedal formulations, reveals a Christology profoundly rooted in the monotheistic soil of Second Temple Judaism, a Christology best understood through the complementary lenses of the Jewish legal principle of agency (shaliah) and the rich Hebraic tradition of personified Wisdom (Chokmah). This study posits that the dominant Trinitarian orthodoxy, which conceives of Jesus as an ontologically co-equal and co-eternal person within a triune Godhead, represents a significant deviation from the pristine, unitarian monotheism espoused by Jesus and the apostles. The biblical portrait, rather, is of Jesus as the ultimate human Shaliach (agent or emissary) of the one true God, his Father, Yahweh. The foundational declaration of Israelite faith, the Shema, insists, "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4). This uncompromising monotheism forms the non-negotiable context for the entire biblical narrative, including the New Testament's presentation of the Messiah. The concept of shaliah, encapsulated in the rabbinic axiom "the one sent is as the one who sent him," was a pervasive legal and theological principle wherein an agent fully represented his principal, bearing his authority, speaking his words, and receiving his honor, without ever being ontologically identical to the principal. This principle is not a novel invention but is deeply embedded in the Hebrew Scriptures; for instance, God tells Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1) and that he would be "as God" to Aaron (Exodus 4:16). The Angel of Yahweh frequently speaks in the first person as God himself (Genesis 16:10-13; Exodus 3:2-6), yet is distinguished from the God who sent him. Likewise, human judges in Israel were called elohim ("gods") because they functioned as God's representatives in judgment (Psalm 82:6), a point Jesus himself explicitly leverages in his defense against charges of blasphemy (John 10:34-36).


It is precisely within this shaliah framework that Jesus’ own claims and the apostolic witness must be situated. His constant refrain is one of subordination and commission: "I have come in my Father's name" (John 5:43); "The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me" (John 14:24); "He who receives me receives Him who sent me" (John 13:20). Even the most exalted titles applied to Jesus are intelligible through this representative lens. Thomas's cry, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28), after the resurrection is not a sudden, unprecedented confession of Trinitarian ontology but rather the ultimate recognition of Jesus as the perfect embodiment of the Father's presence and authority—the supreme agent through whom God is now known and worshipped, fulfilling the precedent of Psalm 82 and the Roman imperial custom of addressing the emperor as Dominus et Deus noster (our Lord and God) in a representational, not ontological, capacity. Trinitarian proof-texts, often cited as insurmountable evidence for Jesus’ pre-existent deity, are compellingly reinterpreted through the paradigm of Wisdom Christology. In Jewish thought (Proverbs 8; Sirach 24; Wisdom of Solomon 7-9), God's Wisdom (Chokmah in Hebrew, Sophia in Greek) was poetically personified as the agent of creation and revelation, the intimate counsel of God, yet was understood as an attribute or eternal plan of God, not a distinct hypostasis. The New Testament authors, particularly John and Paul, appropriated this rich symbolic language to articulate the cosmic significance of the man Jesus. The celebrated prologue of John's Gospel—"In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1)—does not describe a second person of the Godhead. Rather, the Logos is God's eternal reason, creative utterance, and redemptive plan. The phrase "with God" (pros ton theon) signifies proximity and relation, as in a plan held within the mind of its originator. The anarthrous predicate "and the Word was God" (kai theos ên ho logos) is qualitative, indicating the Logos shared the nature and essence of God, as His perfect expression, not that it was numerically identical to the person of God. The Logos then "became flesh" (John 1:14) not in the sense of a divine person inhabiting a human body, but in the sense that God's eternal plan and self-expression found its ultimate, perfect, and final instantiation in the historical human person, Jesus of Nazareth.


Similarly, other high Christological passages yield to this interpretation. In Colossians 1:15-17, Jesus is the "image of the invisible God," language of perfect representation, not identity. He is the "prototokos," the "firstborn of all creation," a title denoting supreme rank and inheritance rights within God's created order, not chronological precedence to it. The statement that all things were created "in him" and "through him" signifies that God's creational purpose was always oriented toward and culminated in the Messiah as the head of the new creation. In Philippians 2:6-11, Jesus, "being in the form of God" (en morphē theou), refers not to his intrinsic divine nature in a pre-human state, but to his glorious status as the sinless Adam and God's plenipotentiary agent on earth. He did not "grasp at" being equal with God but "emptied himself" by relinquishing his rightful messianic glory, choosing instead the path of a servant to the point of a criminal's death. His subsequent exaltation and reception of "the name that is above every name" is a reward bestowed by God for his obedience, a nonsensical transaction if he were already, by nature, Almighty God. It is crucial to acknowledge the counterargument that this view appears to diminish Christ. However, it does not. This perspective must be carefully distinguished from Arianism, which posited a pre-existent created super-angelic being, and from simple adoptionism. The biblical unitarian view holds that Jesus was uniquely conceived by God's Spirit, lived a sinless human life, and was thus the perfect and sole vehicle for God's redemptive plan—truly the monogenēs or "uniquely-begotten" Son. His divinity is therefore functional, representational, and relational, which in the Hebraic mind carried more weight than abstract ontological categories later imported from Greek philosophy, a process evident in the centuries-long development of the doctrine of the Trinity from Nicaea (325 AD) to Constantinople (381 AD) and beyond. The rediscovery of this biblically and historically grounded Christology results in a radical clarification of the gospel itself. The mission of Jesus is no longer a complex intra-Trinitarian drama but the straightforward and profound story of the one God, the Father, acting in and through His chosen human agent, the Messiah Jesus, to defeat sin and death and reconcile the world to Himself (2 Corinthians 5:19). Jesus' work was to perfectly reveal the character of his Father, to serve as the ultimate model of human obedience, to provide the final atoning sacrifice as the unblemished Lamb of God, and to be resurrected and exalted by God as the pioneer of the new creation and Lord over all. The true gospel, therefore, is the proclamation of the Kingdom of the one God, and the call to repentance and faith in His Son, the man Jesus Christ, through whom alone salvation is offered and by whose example we are called to live, all to the glory of God the Father.
