## Church–Traditional Trinitarianism vs. the Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency

The dissertation contrasts traditional Trinitarian Christology with the Biblical Unitarian view by situating both within Hebrew Wisdom literature and the Jewish law of agency. Reading it through the lens of Biblical Unitarianism highlights the strengths of a framework that preserves the original Jewish monotheism of Jesus and the apostles while offering a consistent explanation of Jesus’ identity as Messiah and Son of God.

### Affirming the Centrality of God’s Oneness

A strong feature of the Biblical Unitarian view, as highlighted in the work, is its unwavering adherence to the Shema (Deut. 6:4; Mark 12:29). The author acknowledges how early Christians lived in continuity with Jewish monotheism, a point that Trinitarian theology often stretches by introducing philosophical categories foreign to the biblical world. From a Unitarian perspective, the insistence that only the Father is the one true God (John 17:3) keeps Christian faith aligned with the original biblical revelation rather than later creedal formulations.

### Jesus as God’s Appointed Messiah

The dissertation’s focus on agency (shaliach) resonates deeply with the Unitarian understanding of Jesus. If “a man’s agent is as himself,” then Jesus, as God’s ultimate agent, can bear divine authority without being ontologically God. This concept explains why Jesus could forgive sins, speak with God’s authority, and be worshiped representationally. Rather than requiring an incarnation of God into human flesh, the agency model shows that God was fully at work through His chosen Messiah (Acts 2:22).

### Wisdom Literature as Personification, Not Pre-existence

The discussion of Wisdom traditions offers another point of support for Biblical Unitarianism. Proverbs 8 and related texts use personification to describe God’s wisdom, not to assert a literal second divine being. The Unitarian approach, therefore, sees New Testament references to Christ as “God’s wisdom” (1 Cor. 1:24) as poetic, indicating that Jesus embodies God’s saving plan rather than pre-existing as a co-eternal Logos. This reading avoids the theological conflicts that arose in later centuries when Wisdom was treated as hypostasized deity.

### Historical Development and Doctrinal Accretion

The paper rightly demonstrates that the doctrine of the Trinity emerged gradually, reaching formal expression only by the fourth century. From a Unitarian standpoint, this supports the view that Trinitarianism is not apostolic teaching but the result of philosophical synthesis and theological disputes. While church fathers sought to defend Christ’s importance, their categories increasingly departed from the simplicity of the biblical witness. The Unitarian critique emphasizes a return to that simplicity: one God, the Father, and one man, the Messiah Jesus, through whom God accomplishes salvation (1 Tim. 2:5).

### Contemporary Relevance

The dissertation ends by considering interfaith dialogue, and this is where the Biblical Unitarian perspective shines. A strict monotheism centered on the Father aligns more naturally with Jewish and Islamic monotheism, making the gospel’s proclamation of Jesus as Messiah clearer across traditions. By removing metaphysical complexities that have divided Christians, Biblical Unitarianism reclaims the earliest proclamation: “Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matt. 16:16).

### Conclusion

The dissertation provides valuable historical and theological detail, but when read from a Biblical Unitarian perspective, it confirms that the original faith of Jesus and his apostles was not Trinitarian. Rather, it was centered on the one true God, the Father, and on Jesus as His uniquely empowered agent and Messiah. The categories of wisdom and agency, far from proving Christ’s deity, affirm his role as God’s chosen man — exalted by God, not co-equal with Him.
