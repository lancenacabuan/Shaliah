# Why Biblical Unitarianism is the More Logical Christology

## Introduction

The question of Jesus’ identity has stood at the center of Christian theology for nearly two millennia. Is he “God the Son,” the second person of a triune Godhead, or is he God’s uniquely anointed human Messiah? The dissertation *God-Man or God’s Man?* surveys both traditional Trinitarianism and Biblical Unitarianism in light of Hebrew Wisdom literature and the Jewish law of agency. This essay argues that while Trinitarianism developed into the dominant confession of the Church, Biblical Unitarianism offers the more logically consistent and biblically faithful framework. It preserves the oneness of God, clarifies Jesus’ role, and avoids philosophical paradoxes introduced later in Christian history.

## 1. The Oneness of God in Scripture

At the core of Biblical Unitarianism is fidelity to the Shema: “Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!” (Deut. 6:4 NASB1995). Jesus himself reaffirmed this confession when asked about the greatest commandment (Mark 12:29). In his prayer to the Father, he declared: “This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent” (John 17:3). These texts distinguish clearly between the one God, the Father, and the Messiah whom He sent.

Trinitarianism attempts to reconcile these passages by proposing that God’s oneness is a shared essence among three persons. Yet this explanation complicates rather than clarifies the biblical witness. The simpler and more consistent reading is that God is one person — the Father — and Jesus is His Son, Messiah, and Lord.

## 2. Jesus as God’s Human Messiah

The New Testament repeatedly emphasizes Jesus’ humanity and dependence on God. Peter proclaimed, “Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him” (Acts 2:22). Paul described him as “the man Christ Jesus” who mediates between God and humanity (1 Tim. 2:5).

The Trinitarian model struggles here, since it requires affirming that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. This dual nature leads to paradoxes: how can the omniscient God be ignorant of the day of His return (Mark 13:32)? How can the immortal God die? Biblical Unitarianism avoids these contradictions by recognizing Jesus as fully human, empowered by God, exalted after his resurrection, and appointed as Lord and Messiah (Acts 2:36).

## 3. Wisdom Literature and Personification

One of the dissertation’s strengths lies in examining Hebrew Wisdom literature. Proverbs 8, Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon portray Wisdom as present at creation and acting on God’s behalf. Trinitarians often read this as evidence of Christ’s pre-existence as a divine person.

Yet as scholars like James D.G. Dunn and Dustin Smith argue, wisdom in these texts is a personification of God’s attribute, not a literal second being. When the New Testament calls Jesus “the wisdom of God” (1 Cor. 1:24), it portrays him as the embodiment of God’s saving plan, not as an eternal hypostasis. Thus, the Unitarian reading coheres naturally with Jewish literary conventions, while the Trinitarian reading imposes later theological constructs onto metaphorical texts.

## 4. The Law of Agency and Jesus’ Authority

The Jewish law of agency (shaliach) provides another lens. As the rabbis said, “A man’s agent is as himself.” An agent acts with the authority of the sender, even being addressed as the sender. Applied to Jesus, this principle explains his statements such as, “The one who has seen Me has seen the Father” (John 14:9). As God’s supreme agent, Jesus could bear divine titles and authority without being ontologically God.

Trinitarianism insists that agency is insufficient to account for the worship of Christ, but this overlooks how deeply the agency principle was embedded in Jewish thought. If angels and patriarchs could be addressed with divine authority, how much more God’s ultimate agent — His Messiah? Biblical Unitarianism makes sense of this framework without stretching monotheism into tri-personhood.

## 5. The Historical Development of Trinitarianism

The dissertation carefully outlines the historical rise of Trinitarian doctrine: from early Logos theology to the Nicene Creed (325 CE) and Constantinople (381 CE). What emerges is not an apostolic teaching preserved intact, but a gradual evolution shaped by philosophical categories like *ousia* (essence) and *hypostasis* (person).

While Trinitarians view this as a faithful clarification, it is equally valid to see it as an accretion foreign to the biblical worldview. Biblical Unitarianism points out that the earliest Christians, being Jewish monotheists, proclaimed Jesus as Messiah and Lord under God’s authority. The later insistence on ontological equality with the Father reflects Greek metaphysical concerns rather than Hebrew thought.

## 6. Logical Coherence vs. Theological Paradox

Trinitarian theology admits mystery: “three persons in one essence” is often described as beyond human reason. But paradox should not be mistaken for faithfulness. If logic and Scripture consistently affirm God as one person, then introducing multiple persons undermines coherence.

Biblical Unitarianism maintains both logical clarity and scriptural fidelity. God is one person, the Father. Jesus is the man anointed by God, exalted to His right hand, and entrusted with divine authority. This framework requires no philosophical paradoxes, only the biblical testimony itself.

## Conclusion

The identity of Jesus Christ remains the pivotal question of Christian theology. The Trinitarian model attempts to hold together Scripture’s exalted language about Christ but does so at the cost of paradox and philosophical speculation. Biblical Unitarianism, by contrast, offers a more logical and biblically faithful confession: the Father alone is God, and Jesus is His anointed Messiah, exalted to glory.

This does not diminish Christ — it clarifies him. He is “the man attested by God” (Acts 2:22), “the one mediator between God and mankind” (1 Tim. 2:5), and the risen Lord through whom God will judge the world (Acts 17:31). In the end, Biblical Unitarianism is not only more logical but also more faithful to the original proclamation of the apostles: that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16).
