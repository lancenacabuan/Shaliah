# Church–Traditional Trinitarianism vs. the Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency

This study offers a comprehensive exploration of two contrasting understandings of Jesus Christ: the Church-traditional Trinitarian view and the Biblical Unitarian view, examined through the lenses of Hebrew Wisdom traditions and the Jewish law of agency. The Trinitarian perspective affirms Jesus as God the Son, fully divine and fully human, united with the Father and the Spirit within the triune Godhead. The Unitarian view maintains that God is one person—the Father alone—and that Jesus is His uniquely chosen Messiah, endowed with divine authority but not divine in essence. By situating these perspectives within the religious and intellectual environment of Second Temple Judaism, the study shows how both claim continuity with Israel’s monotheistic heritage. Wisdom literature, where Wisdom is personified as God’s creative companion, and the Jewish principle of agency, which identifies an agent fully with the one who sends him, provide key frameworks for understanding the ways early believers described Jesus’ role.

The work traces how Trinitarian theology developed from the exalted portrayals of Jesus in the New Testament, through the writings of the early church fathers, and into the doctrinal affirmations of the great ecumenical councils. Jesus was increasingly described as the divine Word and Wisdom through whom creation came into being, leading to the declarations of Nicaea and Constantinople that the Son and Spirit share the same divine essence as the Father. At the same time, Biblical Unitarianism recalls older currents within Christianity that emphasized the strict oneness of God, presenting Jesus as a man uniquely appointed and empowered by God, consistent with Jewish monotheism. For this view, the rise of Trinitarian dogma reflects later philosophical influence rather than the faith of the earliest followers.

Figures such as Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Origen demonstrate the diversity and development of early thought, affirming Jesus’ pre-existence and divine status but often subordinating Him to the Father. Alternative voices, such as Adoptionists and Arians, argued that Jesus was created or became God’s Son by appointment, showing how contested His identity was in the early centuries. The debates of the fourth century culminated in the Nicene Creed, which fixed the doctrine of Christ as co-eternal with the Father.

Modern scholarship continues this discussion, with some arguing for a gradual elevation of Jesus’ status from messianic human to divine pre-existent being, while others see devotion to Jesus as divine appearing almost immediately within the earliest Christian communities. Both perspectives are illuminated by the imagery of Wisdom and the principle of agency, which offered ways to express Jesus’ uniqueness without abandoning Jewish monotheism.

By drawing together historical, theological, and biblical analysis, the study demonstrates how these two Christological models each seek to uphold the unity of God while explaining Jesus’ extraordinary role. It shows how the categories of Wisdom and agency provided conceptual tools for articulating His identity, either as divine Son within the Trinity or as God’s supreme human representative. In doing so, it clarifies both the common ground and the differences between the two views and underscores the continuing significance of this debate for theology and interfaith dialogue.
