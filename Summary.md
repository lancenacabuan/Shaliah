# God-Man or God’s Man: Church–Traditional Trinitarianism vs. the Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency

The work sets out to explore one of Christianity’s oldest and most defining debates: *Who is Jesus Christ?* Is He truly God, one with the Father and Spirit in the Trinity, or is He God’s uniquely chosen human Messiah, sent as His ultimate representative? To answer this, the study places two contrasting views—Church-traditional Trinitarianism and Biblical Unitarianism—side by side within the cultural and theological world of ancient Judaism.

The Trinitarian tradition, which took shape over the first four centuries of the church, sees Jesus as God the Son, eternally existing with the Father and Spirit, and made flesh for our salvation. The councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381) cemented this doctrine, declaring Christ of “one essence” with the Father and fully divine. This view emphasizes that the New Testament’s high claims about Jesus—His preexistence in John’s Gospel, His exaltation in Paul’s letters, His reception of worship—can only be understood if He shares God’s very identity.

By contrast, the Biblical Unitarian perspective insists that the earliest Christian faith affirmed one God—the Father alone—as supreme, while Jesus is the human Messiah, God’s Son but not God Himself. According to this reading, Trinitarianism developed later under the influence of Greek philosophy and church politics. Unitarians highlight scriptures like Deuteronomy 6:4 and John 17:3 to argue that calling Jesus “Lord” or “Son of God” does not collapse Him into God’s being but points to His role as God’s agent and chosen representative.

To evaluate these claims, the dissertation turns to two key Jewish concepts: Hebrew Wisdom literature and the law of agency. Wisdom writings such as Proverbs 8 and the Wisdom of Solomon personify God’s wisdom as present at creation and active in the world. Early Christians drew on this imagery to speak of Christ. Trinitarians saw in it evidence of His divine preexistence, while Unitarians treated it as poetic personification, a way of saying that Jesus embodied God’s wisdom without literally existing before His birth.

The Jewish law of agency (shaliach) further illuminates the discussion. In Jewish thought, a commissioned agent carried the full authority of the one who sent him—“the agent is as the principal.” The New Testament repeatedly describes Jesus as the one sent by the Father, acting and speaking with divine authority. Trinitarians claim this agency reveals His ontological unity with God, while Unitarians argue it shows He is God’s supreme but human envoy, worthy of honor because of whom He represents.

The historical survey traces how early Christian writers—Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Athanasius—gradually built the language of divinity around Christ, often by interpreting Wisdom traditions and agency principles. The Arian controversy in the fourth century sharpened the debate, as Arius argued Christ was created while Athanasius defended Him as eternally begotten. The Nicene Creed arose out of these disputes, formalizing the Trinitarian confession that became the standard of orthodoxy.

In conclusion, the dissertation does not simply declare a winner but highlights the depth of the divide: Trinitarianism sees Jesus as God incarnate, essential to salvation, while Biblical Unitarianism sees Him as God’s chosen man, fully human yet exalted. Both sides appeal to the same Jewish and biblical sources—Wisdom traditions and the law of agency—but interpret them differently. By situating this debate in its ancient context, the study seeks to foster clearer understanding, showing that this question of whether Jesus is *God-Man* or *God’s Man* remains a live and vital issue not only within Christianity but also in dialogue with Judaism and Islam.
