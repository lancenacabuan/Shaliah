# Church-Traditional Trinitarianism vs. The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency  

---

## **Abstract**

This dissertation explores the theological divergence between **Church-Traditional Trinitarianism** and the **Biblical Unitarian** view of Jesus Christ, focusing specifically on their respective interpretations of Jesus within the frameworks of **Hebrew Wisdom Literature** and the **Jewish Law of Agency (shaliach)**. While Trinitarianism holds that Jesus is the eternal, preexistent Second Person of the Trinity, coequal with the Father, Biblical Unitarianism affirms that Jesus is the uniquely begotten human Messiah, exalted by God but not ontologically divine.

By examining key biblical texts—such as John 1, Philippians 2, Colossians 1, and Hebrews 1—this study analyzes how each model interprets themes of preexistence, creation, and divine representation. It further evaluates the literary personification of Wisdom in Jewish tradition, showing that these texts do not suggest a literal, preexistent being but rather poetic expressions of God’s own attributes. The Jewish law of agency is presented as a historically grounded framework that clarifies Jesus’ authority as God's representative without implying shared essence.

The findings suggest that the **Biblical Unitarian model offers greater consistency with Second Temple Jewish monotheism, the literary and theological patterns of Scripture, and Jesus’ own self-description**. It maintains the Father as the one true God while honoring Jesus as the fully authorized, glorified Messiah. The study concludes that **Biblical Unitarian Christology provides a coherent, historically rooted, and theologically faithful alternative** to traditional Trinitarianism.
