# The Shaliah Principle and Wisdom Christology: A Biblical Unitarian Reinterpretation of Jesus the Messiah

## Introduction: The Question of Christ's Identity

The central question that has shaped Christian theology for two millennia concerns the identity of Jesus of Nazareth, and no doctrine has proven more divisive than the traditional formulation of the Trinity, which asserts that Jesus Christ is the second person of a triune Godhead, eternally pre-existent and ontologically divine. However, a careful examination of Scripture through the interpretive lens of first-century Jewish thought, particularly the Shaliah principle and Wisdom traditions, reveals that the earliest Christian communities understood Jesus not as God himself but as God's supreme human agent, the promised Messiah who perfectly embodied divine wisdom and carried divine authority without possessing divine essence. This study contends that the Biblical Unitarian position—which affirms Jesus as the unique, sinless, miraculously conceived Son of God while maintaining his full humanity—represents the authentic apostolic teaching that was gradually obscured by Hellenistic philosophical categories foreign to the Hebrew worldview of Jesus and his first followers.

## The Jewish Shaliah Principle: Foundation for Understanding Divine Agency

The concept of Shaliach (plural: Shluchim) in Jewish law and tradition provides the crucial hermeneutical key for understanding how the New Testament writers could apply exalted titles and functions to Jesus without thereby claiming his ontological deity. In rabbinic literature, the principle is succinctly stated: "A man's agent (shaliah) is as himself" (Mishnah Berakoth 5:5), meaning that the authorized representative carries the full authority of the sender and must be received as if receiving the sender personally. This legal and cultural framework permeated Jewish society in the Second Temple period, governing everything from business transactions to religious duties, and it established that an agent could act with the full authority of the principal without confusion about their distinct identities. When we recognize that Jesus explicitly identified himself as one who was "sent" by the Father—using the Greek apostello, which corresponds to the Hebrew shalach—we discover that his claims to divine authority and his acceptance of reverence were perfectly consistent with his role as God's ultimate agent rather than requiring his personal deity.

## Old Testament Precedents: Divine Agency in Israel's History

The Hebrew Scriptures provide numerous examples of human agents who bore divine titles and exercised divine prerogatives without any suggestion that they were ontologically divine, establishing a pattern that illuminates the New Testament's presentation of Jesus. Moses serves as the paradigmatic example, for God explicitly told him, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1 ESV), and in Exodus 4:16, God declares that Moses would be "as God" to Aaron, using language that parallels the later rabbinic formulation of agency. The angel of the LORD in numerous passages speaks in the first person as God himself (Genesis 16:10-13; Exodus 3:2-6; Judges 13:21-22), leading those who encounter him to declare they have "seen God," yet orthodox Jewish interpretation never concluded that these angels were actually YHWH himself but rather his authorized representatives who could speak and act with divine authority. Similarly, human judges in Israel were called "gods" (elohim) in Psalm 82:6, which Jesus himself cited in John 10:34-36 to defend his own divine titles, arguing from the lesser to the greater that if human judges could be called "gods" because "the word of God came to them," how much more could he who was uniquely "consecrated and sent into the world" by the Father bear such designations.

## Wisdom Christology: The Pre-existent Plan, Not Person

The identification of Jesus with divine Wisdom (Sophia in Greek, Hokmah in Hebrew) provides another crucial framework for understanding high Christological passages without necessitating personal pre-existence or ontological deity. Jewish wisdom literature, particularly Proverbs 8, Wisdom of Solomon, and Sirach, personified Wisdom as God's first creation, his agent in creating and sustaining the universe, yet these texts never suggest that Wisdom was a distinct divine person but rather God's attribute or purpose given literary personification. When Paul writes that Christ is "the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:24 ESV) and describes him as the one "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:3 ESV), he draws on this rich tradition to present Jesus as the embodiment of God's eternal purpose rather than an eternally pre-existent person. The prologue of John's Gospel, often cited as the strongest proof of Christ's deity, actually reinforces this Wisdom Christology when properly understood: the Logos (Word) that was "with God" and "was God" refers not to a second divine person but to God's eternal plan, purpose, and self-expression, which "became flesh" (John 1:14 ESV) in the person of Jesus Christ, just as Wisdom was said to "tabernacle" among humanity (Sirach 24:8).

## Reinterpreting High Christological Texts Through Agency and Wisdom

The passages most frequently cited as proof of Christ's deity take on new meaning when read through the dual lens of agency and Wisdom Christology, revealing how the early church could use the highest possible language for Jesus while maintaining Jewish monotheism. Philippians 2:5-11, rather than describing a pre-existent divine being who became human, presents Jesus as the second Adam who, unlike the first Adam who grasped at equality with God (Genesis 3:5), did not consider such equality something to be seized but instead embraced the path of obedient suffering, for which God highly exalted him and gave him the name above every name—a sequence that makes little sense if Jesus already possessed divine status. The claim in Colossians 1:15-20 that "all things were created through him and for him" echoes precisely what Jewish literature said about Wisdom (Proverbs 3:19; 8:22-31; Wisdom 7:22-8:1), indicating that Jesus is the embodiment of God's eternal creative purpose rather than a separate creator deity. Even Thomas's climactic confession, "My Lord and my God" (John 20:28 ESV), while certainly expressing the highest possible reverence, follows the established pattern of addressing God's supreme agent with divine titles, just as the Israelites "believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses" (Exodus 14:31 ESV) without confusing their identities.

## The Shema and Apostolic Monotheism

The foundational Jewish confession of faith, the Shema—"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4 ESV)—remained absolutely central to the faith of Jesus and the apostolic church, and their reaffirmation of this strict monotheism provides decisive evidence against the later Trinitarian formulations. Jesus himself, when asked about the greatest commandment, began by quoting the Shema (Mark 12:29), and notably, the scribe who questioned him agreed that God "is one, and there is no other besides him" (Mark 12:32 ESV), to which Jesus responded that the scribe was "not far from the kingdom of God" (Mark 12:34 ESV)—hardly the response we would expect if believing in Jesus's deity were essential to entering that kingdom. Paul explicitly maintains Jewish monotheism even while exalting Christ, writing, "For us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist" (1 Corinthians 8:6 ESV), carefully distinguishing the "one God" who is the Father from the "one Lord" who is Jesus Christ, using the prepositions "from" (ek) for the Father as source and "through" (dia) for Christ as agent. The consistent New Testament pattern identifies the Father alone as "the only true God" (John 17:3 ESV) and "the one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:6 ESV), while Jesus is presented as the mediator between this one God and humanity (1 Timothy 2:5).

## Jesus's Self-Understanding: Son, Not God

An examination of Jesus's own words and self-designations reveals a consistent pattern of distinguishing himself from God while claiming the highest possible status as God's unique representative and Son. Jesus repeatedly spoke of God as "my Father" and "your Father," but never "our Father" in a way that would equate his sonship with that of his disciples, indicating his unique relationship while maintaining the Creator-creature distinction. His preferred self-designation, "Son of Man," drawn from Daniel 7:13-14, identified him as the human figure who receives dominion and glory from the "Ancient of Days," not as the Ancient of Days himself. In his high priestly prayer, Jesus defines eternal life as knowing "the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17:3 ESV), a formulation that would be inexplicable if Jesus understood himself to be that only true God. Even in his most exalted claims, such as "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30 ESV), the context reveals functional unity of purpose and action rather than ontological identity, as Jesus immediately clarifies by citing Psalm 82 to show that divine language can be applied to human agents.

## The Development of Trinitarian Doctrine: A Historical Departure

The emergence of Trinitarian doctrine in the fourth century represents not the clarification of apostolic teaching but a fundamental departure from it, driven by the church's engagement with Greek philosophical categories foreign to the Hebraic mindset of the New Testament authors. The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) and subsequent councils employed terms like homoousios (same substance) and hypostasis (subsistence) that appear nowhere in Scripture and reflect Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics rather than biblical categories. The fierce debates and multiple reformulations required to establish Trinitarian orthodoxy—from Nicaea to Constantinople to Chalcedon—testify to the doctrine's lack of clear biblical foundation, as even its defenders acknowledge that it must be derived through complex theological reasoning rather than explicit scriptural teaching. The political enforcement of Trinitarian doctrine through imperial decree, the suppression of alternative views as heresy, and the persecution of those who maintained biblical unitarianism reveal how far the church had departed from the simplicity of the apostolic confession that "Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16 ESV).

## The True Gospel Rediscovered

Understanding Jesus as God's supreme human agent rather than God himself does not diminish but rather clarifies and enhances the gospel message, restoring the biblical emphasis on what God has accomplished through the man Christ Jesus. The scandal of the cross lies not in God dying—an impossibility that requires logical gymnastics to explain—but in God's vindication of a crucified Messiah, overturning human expectations of power and glory. The resurrection becomes not merely the restoration of a divine being to his natural state but God's mighty act of raising and exalting the faithful human who perfectly embodied divine wisdom and accomplished divine purposes. The hope of salvation shifts from an abstract participation in divine nature to the concrete promise that we too can become children of God, joint heirs with Christ, following the pattern of the firstborn among many brothers and sisters (Romans 8:29). Prayer and worship take on their proper biblical form as we approach the Father through the mediator he has appointed, honoring the Son precisely because we honor the Father who sent him, without the confusion of addressing prayers to a committee of divine persons.

## Implications for Faith and Practice

The recovery of biblical unitarianism has profound implications for how we understand and live out the Christian faith, calling us back to the Jewish roots of our faith and the actual teaching of Jesus and his apostles. First, it restores the genuine humanity of Jesus, making him truly our example and forerunner, one who "in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15 ESV), rather than a divine being merely play-acting at humanity. Second, it clarifies the nature of salvation as God's work of transforming human beings into the image of his Son, not through ontological deification but through moral and spiritual transformation that enables us to glorify God as Jesus did. Third, it simplifies Christian proclamation to the biblical message that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), calling all people to acknowledge him as God's appointed king rather than requiring belief in philosophical formulations about divine substances and persons. Fourth, it enables genuine dialogue with Jews and Muslims who affirm strict monotheism, removing the stumbling block of apparent polytheism while maintaining the unique status of Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Finally, it focuses our worship where Scripture does—on the "one God and Father of all" (Ephesians 4:6 ESV)—while honoring Jesus as the one through whom we have access to that Father.

## Responding to Objections

The most serious objection to biblical unitarianism concerns the worship of Jesus depicted in the New Testament, which Trinitarians argue exceeds what would be appropriate for any created being. However, the biblical concept of proskuneo (often translated "worship") encompasses a range of reverence from honor given to human authorities to the exclusive devotion due to God, and the context must determine which is meant. When Jesus receives proskuneo, it consistently relates to his status as Messiah and Lord appointed by God, parallel to how David received proskuneo as king (1 Chronicles 29:20) without any suggestion of deity. The doxologies that include Christ alongside the Father (such as Revelation 5:13) follow the Jewish pattern of honoring God and his appointed representative together, as when Israel "believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses" (Exodus 14:31 ESV). The objection that only God can forgive sins ignores that Jesus explicitly received this authority from the Father (Matthew 9:6-8) and that he commissioned his apostles to forgive sins in his name (John 20:23), showing that this authority can be delegated. The claim that denying Christ's deity undermines the efficacy of his atonement rests on Anselm's satisfaction theory rather than biblical teaching, which emphasizes that God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ (2 Corinthians 5:19) rather than Christ appeasing God's wrath as a second divine person.

## Conclusion: The Call to Return to Biblical Faith

The biblical unitarian understanding of Jesus Christ as God's supreme human agent, the embodiment of divine wisdom, and the promised Messiah who perfectly fulfilled God's purposes represents not a novel interpretation but a return to the faith once delivered to the saints. This view honors the genuine monotheism that Jesus himself affirmed while recognizing his unique status as the Son of God who bears divine authority and deserves the highest honor as God's appointed Lord and Christ. It makes sense of the biblical data without requiring philosophical categories foreign to Scripture, maintains continuity with God's dealings with Israel through appointed agents, and presents a gospel that truly offers hope to humanity—that in Christ, we see what God intended humanity to become and through Christ, we can be transformed into that same image. The church must courageously reexamine its traditions in light of Scripture, willing to abandon even cherished doctrines that obscure rather than illuminate the biblical witness. Only by understanding who Jesus truly is—the man approved by God with mighty works and wonders and signs, whom God raised from the dead and made both Lord and Christ—can we properly glorify God, emulate Christ, and foster relationships based on the truth of the gospel. The invitation remains what it always was: to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and through believing, to have life in his name (John 20:31).
