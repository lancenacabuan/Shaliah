**Rediscovering a Biblical Christology: Jesus as God's Agent and Wisdom**

A rigorous exploration of the person and work of Jesus Christ—when disentangled from centuries of Hellenistic philosophy and post-apostolic creedal development—reveals a Christology deeply rooted in the monotheistic framework of Second Temple Judaism. This study argues that such a Christology is best apprehended through the complementary lenses of the Jewish legal principle of agency (*shaliah*) and the Hebraic tradition of personified Wisdom (*Chokmah*). It contends that the prevailing Trinitarian orthodoxy—which identifies Jesus as an ontologically co-equal, co-eternal person within a triune Godhead—constitutes a substantial departure from the original, unitarian monotheism affirmed by Jesus and the apostles. The biblical witness portrays Jesus not as a divine co-equal, but as the consummate human *shaliach* (agent or emissary) of Yahweh, the one true God and Father.

The Shema—“Hear, O Israel: Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4)—establishes the uncompromising monotheism that forms the non-negotiable context of the entire biblical narrative, including the New Testament presentation of the Messiah. The *shaliah* principle, encapsulated in the rabbinic axiom “the one sent is as the one who sent him,” describes a legal and theological model whereby an agent acts with full authority on behalf of the principal without being ontologically identical to him. This concept permeates the Hebrew Scriptures. For instance, God tells Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1), and that he would be “as God” to Aaron (Exodus 4:16). The Angel of Yahweh frequently speaks in the first person as God (Genesis 16:10–13; Exodus 3:2–6), yet is distinguished from Yahweh himself. Similarly, human judges in Israel were referred to as *elohim* (“gods”) because they operated as God’s representatives (Psalm 82:6)—a precedent Jesus cites in his defense against charges of blasphemy (John 10:34–36).

This robust Jewish theology of divine agency—in which human or angelic envoys are vested with divine authority while remaining distinct from Yahweh—provides the essential framework for understanding Jesus’ own claims and the apostolic witness. His constant affirmation is one of dependence and commission: “I have come in my Father’s name” (John 5:43); “The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me” (John 14:24); “He who receives me receives him who sent me” (John 13:20). Even the most exalted titles attributed to Jesus become intelligible within this representative paradigm. Thomas’s exclamation, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28), is not a Trinitarian confession but the recognition of Jesus as the supreme embodiment of God's authority, akin to the Roman practice of addressing the emperor as *Dominus et Deus noster* in a representational rather than ontological sense.

Trinitarian proof texts, typically invoked to support Jesus’ preexistent deity, are compellingly reinterpreted through the lens of Wisdom Christology. In Jewish literature (e.g., Proverbs 8; Sirach 24; Wisdom of Solomon 7–9), God’s Wisdom is personified as the agent of creation and revelation—intimately associated with God but not a separate hypostasis. The New Testament authors, particularly John and Paul, appropriate this imagery to express the cosmic significance of Jesus. John’s prologue—“In the beginning was the Word (Logos)... and the Word was God” (John 1:1)—does not describe a second divine person, but God’s eternal reason and redemptive plan. The Logos “became flesh” (John 1:14) not by incarnation of a divine being, but by the historical manifestation of God’s purpose in the man Jesus.

Likewise, passages such as Colossians 1:15–17 and Philippians 2:6–11 affirm Jesus as the image and representative of God, not his ontological equal. In Colossians, Jesus is the *prototokos*—the firstborn over all creation—not as preexistent deity, but as heir and head of the new creation. Philippians’ “form of God” (*morphē theou*) denotes representative status, not shared essence. Jesus’ exaltation follows his obedience unto death—a meaningless act if he were already Almighty God.

Parallel to the *shaliah* theme, Wisdom in the Old Testament is depicted as God’s created yet eternal attribute, present at creation but never equated with God himself. Philo of Alexandria’s Logos-Wisdom theology, influential in Second Temple Judaism, further reinforces this representational understanding. Early Christian writers adopted this framework to present Jesus not as an eternal second person, but as the embodied Logos—God’s self-expression and appointed agent of salvation (1 Corinthians 8:6; Colossians 1:15–17).

This Christology also illuminates Jesus’ title “Son of Man” (Daniel 7:13–14), a figure given dominion by God yet remaining subordinate. Jesus’ prayer in John 17:3—“that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent”—confirms his distinct, subordinate identity. The apostolic writings consistently maintain this dynamic: Jesus depends on the Father (John 5:19–23), the Father remains the only true God (James 2:19), and yet Jesus is worthy of worship because he functions as God’s singular representative.

Passages like John 1:1, Hebrews 1:3, and Philippians 2:6 are often cited to prove Jesus’ deity. However, within the agency and Wisdom paradigm, these texts affirm Jesus’ functional divinity. The “Word was God” implies a qualitative likeness, not numerical identity. Hebrews’ “exact imprint” (*charakter*) speaks to representation, just as a wax seal bears a king’s image. “Form of God” in Philippians denotes visible glory and divine commission, not essence. Thus, Jesus’ unity with the Father (“I and the Father are one,” John 10:30) signifies unity of will and purpose, not identity of being.

Moreover, Jesus' prerogatives—receiving worship, forgiving sins, exercising divine authority—are not contradictions of monotheism within this framework. In the biblical pattern, agents of God may receive worship or act with divine authority without implying ontological divinity (Exodus 25:22; Ezekiel 10). Jesus mediates God’s forgiveness (Mark 2:5–12) as the fulfillment of Jeremiah 31:34’s promise, enacted through his sacrificial death (Hebrews 8:7–13).

Even Revelation 22:13 (“I am the Alpha and the Omega”) can be understood metaphorically, consistent with apocalyptic symbolism and Wisdom literature. The language of “eternality” reflects God’s purposes through Jesus rather than Jesus' own eternal pre-existence. The philosophical categories underpinning the later creeds—substance, essence, hypostasis—were absent from the apostolic worldview and represent Hellenistic reinterpretations of a fundamentally Hebraic message.

While some may argue that this Christology diminishes Jesus, it does not. It differs sharply from both Arianism and adoptionism. Rather, it affirms Jesus as uniquely conceived by the Spirit, sinless, and exalted—*monogenēs*, the uniquely begotten Son. His divinity is functional, relational, and representative, in keeping with biblical categories. The later doctrine of the Trinity developed through centuries of theological evolution, shaped by external philosophical debates. A return to the original, Jewish context restores the clarity and power of the gospel: one God, the Father, acting through His chosen human Messiah, Jesus.

Jesus' mission is not a metaphysical drama within a triune Godhead but the real historical embodiment of God’s redemptive plan. He reveals the Father, offers the final atonement, and is exalted as Lord of the new creation. The true gospel proclaims the kingdom of the one God and invites faith in His Son, the man Jesus Christ, through whom salvation is offered.

Rediscovering Jesus as God’s anointed agent and personified Wisdom reclaims the simplicity and radical monotheism of the apostolic gospel. It transforms our theology and worship: we worship the Father through the Son by the Spirit, proclaiming one God and trusting in the one whom He has sent.
