# **Jesus as God’s Agent: A Biblical Unitarian Christology**

## Introduction

Biblical Unitarianism holds that God is one person—the Father—and that Jesus is His uniquely begotten human Son, the Messiah. Unlike Trinitarianism, which affirms that Jesus is fully God and co-eternal with the Father, Biblical Unitarianism asserts that Jesus is not ontologically divine but serves as God's appointed representative. This Christology is rooted in the strict monotheism of the Hebrew Bible, affirmed by Jesus himself (Mark 12:29), and clarified through the ancient Jewish concept of agency.

## The Jewish Law of Agency (*Shaliah*)

In ancient Judaism, a *shaliah* (שליח)—a legal agent—acted on behalf of another with full authority to speak or act in that person’s name. The principle is codified in the rabbinic maxim:

> “The one who is sent (*shaliah*) is as the one who sent him.” (Mishnah, *Berakhot* 5:5; *Kiddushin* 2:2)

This does not imply that the agent *is* the sender in being or nature, but that the agent fully represents the sender’s will and authority. The *shaliah* principle forms the interpretive background for understanding statements where Jesus is depicted as speaking and acting for God.

## Jesus and Wisdom Christology

In Second Temple Jewish thought, God's Word (*logos*) and Wisdom (*sophia*) were often personified as preexistent expressions of God’s creative and redemptive activity (cf. Proverbs 8; Sirach 24; Wisdom of Solomon 7). These were not separate divine persons but attributes or manifestations of God.

The Gospel of John opens with,

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (John 1:1)

A Biblical Unitarian reading understands "the Word" not as a second divine person but as God's self-expression or creative utterance—later embodied in the man Jesus (John 1:14). Jesus becomes the personal embodiment of God's Word and Wisdom, not their preexistent possessor.

## Jesus as God’s Representative (Agent Christology)

The New Testament consistently portrays Jesus as acting with divine authority but distinct from God:

* **Sent by God**: “The one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world” (John 10:36)
* **Subordinate to God**: “The Father is greater than I” (John 14:28)
* **Dependent on God**: “I can do nothing on my own... I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me.” (John 5:30)

In line with Jewish agency, Jesus speaks with the authority of God without being God Himself. This concept resolves tension in texts where Jesus receives worship or forgives sins, as agents can bear divine prerogatives on behalf of their sender.

## Rebuttals to Trinitarian Prooftexts

### John 1:1 – “The Word was God”

The Greek phrase *kai theos ēn ho logos* lacks the definite article before *theos*, suggesting a qualitative or adjectival sense—“the Word was divine” or “God-like.” Contextually, this fits with Wisdom/Word personification language from Jewish thought. The Logos is not a second person but the divine rationale or expression that became flesh in Jesus.

### John 8:58 – “Before Abraham was, I am”

Trinitarians see this as a claim to deity by connecting “I am” (*egō eimi*) to God’s self-identification in Exodus 3:14. However, *egō eimi* is a common Greek phrase of self-identification. The statement may simply affirm Jesus' messianic foreordination in God’s plan, not ontological preexistence. Moreover, the Greek grammar favors timeless significance, not a declaration of divinity.

### John 20:28 – “My Lord and my God!”

Thomas’s exclamation can be understood as a confessional recognition of God working through Jesus, akin to declarations like “God was with you!” (cf. Genesis 21:22). Alternatively, some scholars propose Thomas is addressing both Jesus (“My Lord”) and the Father (“my God”), consistent with high reverence for Jesus as God’s agent without conflating his identity with God Himself.

## Historical Development of Trinitarian Doctrine

The doctrine of the Trinity did not emerge directly from the teachings of Jesus or the apostles but gradually developed over centuries. Early Christian writers like Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Origen speculated about Christ’s nature using Greco-Roman philosophical categories. The formal doctrine was not established until the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), under significant imperial influence.

As Alister McGrath notes:

> "The New Testament does not contain an explicit doctrine of the Trinity." (*Christian Theology: An Introduction*, p. 253)

Instead, the earliest Christian faith was centered on one God—the Father—and Jesus as His exalted Messiah (Acts 2:36).

## Worship of Jesus in a Unitarian Framework

Biblical Unitarians affirm that Jesus is worthy of honor, worship, and devotion as the glorified Messiah and Son of God. This worship is always mediated and directed to the Father through the Son (Philippians 2:9–11, Revelation 5). It does not entail ontological equality with God but acknowledges the role of Jesus as the appointed Lord (*kyrios*) through whom God acts.

## Conclusion

Biblical Unitarian Christology maintains fidelity to the strict monotheism of the Hebrew Scriptures and the teachings of Jesus. It sees Jesus as the uniquely begotten human Son of God, God’s supreme agent and Messiah, exalted to divine authority but not divine in essence. This view aligns with early Jewish-Christian understanding and avoids philosophical speculations that developed later into Trinitarian dogma.

Rather than diminishing Jesus, this framework honors his true identity, mission, and exaltation as the mediator between God and humanity (1 Timothy 2:5). It invites believers to follow Jesus as the one sent by the one true God—the Father.
