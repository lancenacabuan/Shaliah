### Second Temple Judaism and Jewish Monotheism

In the vibrant tapestry of Second Temple Judaism, spanning roughly from the reconstruction of the Temple in 516 BCE to its destruction in 70 CE, Jewish monotheism stood as an unyielding pillar, affirming the absolute oneness and uniqueness of Yahweh as the sole Creator and sovereign God, devoid of ontological equals or co-eternal partners, as echoed in texts like Deuteronomy 6:4 and Isaiah 44:6-8, where God declares, "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god."

This era, marked by Hellenistic influences and apocalyptic expectations, witnessed the development of intermediary figures—angels, exalted patriarchs, and personified divine attributes like Wisdom and the Word—yet these never compromised the core monotheistic framework, functioning instead as agents or extensions of God's will rather than independent deities.

### The Jewish Law of Agency (Shaliah)

Central to this was the Jewish law of agency, or shaliah (from the Hebrew "to send"), a principle articulated in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud (e.g., Berakhot 5:5 and Kiddushin 41b-42a) but rooted in biblical precedents, where an agent's actions and words are legally and functionally equivalent to those of the principal, encapsulated in the dictum "a man's agent is like himself."

This allowed representatives to bear divine authority, perform miracles, and even be addressed with divine titles without ontological fusion; for instance, Moses is made "like God" (elohim) to Pharaoh in Exodus 7:1, wielding Yahweh's power to turn the Nile to blood and part the Red Sea, yet remaining a mortal servant sent by God (Exodus 3:10-15).

Similarly, the Angel of the Lord speaks as Yahweh in Genesis 22:11-18 and Judges 6:11-23, promising blessings and executing judgments, but is distinguished as a dispatched messenger, not Yahweh Himself.

Prophets like Elijah and Elisha, commissioned by God, raise the dead and call down fire (1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 1:9-12), embodying divine functions as agents without claiming divinity.

Even human judges are termed elohim in Exodus 21:6 and Psalm 82:6, representing God's justice on earth.

This agency principle, pervasive in Second Temple thought as seen in texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls and Philo's writings, where divine intermediaries like the Logos act as God's viceroy, provided a conceptual bridge for understanding exalted figures without polytheistic implications.

### Hebrew Intertestamental Wisdom Literature

Interwoven with this was Hebrew wisdom literature, evolving from canonical Proverbs through intertestamental works like Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) and the Wisdom of Solomon, where Wisdom (hokhmah in Hebrew, sophia in Greek) is poetically personified as a feminine entity present at creation, delighting in God and aiding in ordering the cosmos (Proverbs 8:22-31; Sirach 24:1-22; Wisdom 7:22-8:1), yet explicitly depicted as a created attribute or emanation of God—"The Lord created me at the beginning of his work" (Proverbs 8:22)—not a pre-existent hypostasis or separate person.

In Wisdom of Solomon 9:9-10, Wisdom sits by God's throne, reflecting His glory and executing His purposes, but remains subordinate, a mirror of divine mind rather than co-equal deity, aligning with Jewish monotheism's aversion to ontological plurality.

This personification served didactic and theological ends, emphasizing God's eternal plan (logos or memra in Targumic traditions) made manifest in history, particularly through Torah or messianic figures, without implying literal pre-existence as a divine being.

### Trinitarianism vs. Biblical Unitarian Christology

Against this backdrop, the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus Christ emerges not as the ontological "God-Man" of later church-traditional Trinitarianism—formalized in councils like Nicaea (325 CE) and Chalcedon (451 CE), which posited Jesus as homoousios (of the same substance) with the Father, fully God and fully man in hypostatic union—but as God's ultimate man, the shaliah par excellence, embodying divine agency and wisdom in a functional, representational sense.

Trinitarianism, developing amid Greco-Roman philosophical influences and post-apostolic debates, retroactively imposed a tri-personal ontology onto Scripture, arguing for Jesus' eternal pre-existence and co-equality based on high Christological passages, yet this strains against the Jewish monotheistic matrix of early Christianity, where Jesus is repeatedly depicted as sent by the Father (John 5:36-38; 6:38; Galatians 4:4), subordinate (John 14:28: "The Father is greater than I"), and exalted post-resurrection (Acts 2:36: "God has made him both Lord and Messiah").

Biblical Unitarianism, by contrast, views Jesus as the human Messiah, begotten by God's spirit at conception (Luke 1:35; Matthew 1:18-20), not eternally generated, fulfilling prophetic hopes as the "son of God" in a Davidic, representational vein (Psalm 2:7; 2 Samuel 7:14), without ontological divinity.

### Reinterpreting High Christological Passages

High Christological texts, often wielded as Trinitarian proof-texts, yield coherently to reinterpretation through the lenses of shaliah and Wisdom Christology; for example, John 1:1-14's "In the beginning was the Word" echoes Proverbs 8's personified Wisdom, portraying the logos not as a pre-existent second person but as God's eternal purpose or plan incarnated in Jesus, the man through whom God spoke creation anew (Hebrews 1:2), with "the Word became flesh" signifying the historical realization of divine intent in a human being, not a divine hypostasis assuming humanity.

Trinitarians counter that John's prologue implies ontological deity, citing "the Word was God" (John 1:1c) and Thomas' confession "My Lord and my God" (John 20:28), yet in agency terms, this reflects functional equivalence—the shaliah bearing the principal's name and authority (Exodus 23:20-21)—and Wisdom's role as God's image, without necessitating co-eternality, as even Philo described the logos as a created intermediary.

Similarly, Philippians 2:6-11's kenosis hymn, lauded by Trinitarians for depicting Jesus' pre-existent equality with God emptied into human form, aligns better with unitarian Adam Christology: Jesus, as the second Adam (Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:45-49), did not grasp at equality like Adam in Eden (Genesis 3:5-6) but humbled himself in obedience, earning exaltation to "Lord" status at resurrection, not resuming divine prerogative.

Objections arise that this diminishes Jesus' cosmic role, but unitarianism preserves his supremacy as God's appointed heir (Hebrews 1:2-4), superior to angels as the ultimate agent, without violating monotheism.

Colossians 1:15-20, another pillar of Trinitarian high Christology, calls Jesus "the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation," through whom "all things were created," yet in Second Temple context, "firstborn" denotes rank and inheritance (Psalm 89:27), not temporal origin, and creation "through" him evokes Wisdom's instrumental role (Proverbs 8:30; Wisdom 9:1-2), referring to Jesus as the goal and agent of new creation post-resurrection (Colossians 1:18: "firstborn from the dead"), not literal pre-existent creator, as God alone creates in Isaiah 44:24.

Trinitarians insist on ontological pre-existence here, but this imports later creedal categories, ignoring Paul's unitarian affirmations like 1 Corinthians 8:6—"one God, the Father... and one Lord, Jesus Christ"—distinguishing source from agent.

Hebrews 1:8-10 quotes Psalm 45:6-7 and 102:25-27, addressing the Son as "God" whose throne endures, yet in agency framework, this applies divine titles representationally to the anointed king-Messiah (Psalm 45's original context), with creation language signifying renewal through Jesus, not his personal act, aligning with Wisdom's creational mediation without hypostatic independence.

A disclaimer is warranted: while some scholars detect "early high Christology" in these passages, suggesting rapid deification of Jesus within Jewish circles, historical evidence from Qumran and pseudepigrapha shows such language accommodated functional elevation without ontological shift, and post-70 CE rabbinic reactions against "two powers" heresies targeted binitarian excesses, not unitarian agency.

### Logical and Contextual Evaluation

Approaching this unknowledgeably yet logically, assuming only sound reading comprehension and cultural-historical-biblical context, the unitarian perspective proves more sensible: it harmonizes the New Testament's Jewish roots, avoiding Trinitarianism's logical tensions—like how one God can be three co-equal persons without tritheism or modalism (critiqued in unitarian analyses as incoherent, e.g., three equaling one)—and sidesteps the need for extra-biblical philosophical scaffolding like ousia and hypostasis, which evolved amid imperial pressures at Nicaea.

Trinitarianism, while defended historically as safeguarding Jesus' salvific efficacy (e.g., only God can atone infinitely), falters biblically, as Scripture attributes salvation to God's plan through a sinless human agent (Hebrews 2:17-18; 4:15), whose obedience as man reverses Adam's fall, rendering divine incarnation unnecessary and contradictory to texts like Numbers 23:19 ("God is not a man").

Unitarianism's coherence lies in its fidelity to monotheism: Jesus prays to, submits to, and reveals the one true God (John 17:3; Mark 10:18), without the interpretive gymnastics required to reconcile apparent subordination with co-equality.

### Conclusion: Reintroducing the Biblical Jesus

In conclusion, reintroducing the biblical Jesus unveils him not as the inscrutable God-Man of Trinitarian dogma, but as God's man—the anointed Messiah, born of Mary, empowered by the Spirit, who lived sinlessly to fulfill Torah, proclaimed God's kingdom, died as the Passover lamb to atone for sins (1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Peter 1:18-19), rose as vindication of his sonship (Romans 1:4), and ascended as exalted Lord, commissioning disciples to spread repentance and forgiveness (Luke 24:46-49).

His true mission was to manifest God's wisdom and love, drawing humanity to the Father through faith in him as the way (John 14:6), not as an object of worship co-equal to God, but as the faithful agent whose obedience secures salvation.

Correcting his identity restores the original gospel's simplicity: a call to monotheistic devotion to Yahweh through His Son, fostering accessible faith unburdened by metaphysical puzzles, emphasizing ethical living, hope in resurrection, and God's ultimate sovereignty, thereby reclaiming Christianity's Jewish essence from centuries of Hellenistic accretion.
