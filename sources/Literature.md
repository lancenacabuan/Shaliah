God-Man or God's Man: Church-Traditional Trinitarianism vs. The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Intertestamental Wisdom Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency during Second Temple Judaism

The debate between traditional Trinitarianism and Biblical Unitarianism over the identity of Jesus Christ continues to occupy a central place in theological inquiry, not only because of its implications for Christian dogma but also because of its connection to the lived faith and praxis of the earliest believers. Trinitarian orthodoxy, crystallized in the creeds of Nicaea (325 CE) and Constantinople (381 CE), argues that Jesus is fully God and fully man, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Spirit. This formulation rests heavily on readings of select New Testament passages interpreted through later metaphysical categories foreign to the biblical worldview. By contrast, Biblical Unitarianism asserts that Jesus is not God in an ontological sense but is rather God’s chosen Messiah, God’s agent (שָׁלִיחַ, shaliaḥ) who acts fully on behalf of the One God of Israel. When placed within the historical, theological, and literary context of Second Temple Judaism, particularly the frameworks of intertestamental Wisdom literature and the Jewish law of agency, the Unitarian reading proves to be more coherent, biblically grounded, and faithful to the monotheism of Israel than the later dogmatic Trinitarian construct.

Second Temple Jewish literature testifies to a rich tradition of mediatorial figures who represent God’s presence without collapsing the distinction between God and His agent. In Wisdom texts such as Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon, and Baruch, divine Wisdom is portrayed as preexistent, not as a hypostatic person distinct from God but as a poetic and theological representation of God’s plan, ordering power, and salvific will. Wisdom comes forth from God, dwells among men, and guides Israel, yet remains inseparable from God’s own purposes (Sirach 24:3–12; Wisdom 7:22–8:1). This conceptual world provided the soil in which New Testament Christology was articulated: Jesus embodies and enacts God’s Wisdom, not as an eternal divine person but as the concrete realization of God’s plan in history. He is the enfleshment of God’s Logos/Wisdom, not as God Himself, but as the agent through whom God accomplishes redemption. This framework avoids the ontological dualism smuggled into Christianity through Hellenistic metaphysics and preserves the Jewish understanding of divine unity.

The Jewish law of agency (shaliaḥ) further illuminates how Jesus’ divine prerogatives can be affirmed without ascribing to him deity in essence. In rabbinic thought, “a man’s agent is as himself” (shlucho shel adam kemoto). Agents could speak in the name of their sender, carry his authority, and even be addressed as though they were the sender himself. Scripture furnishes multiple examples: Moses is described as “god” to Pharaoh (Exod 7:1), though no one confused Moses with YHWH ontologically. The angel of YHWH often speaks in the first person as God (Exod 3:2–6), receiving reverence, though he remains a messenger. Davidic kings were called “sons of God” (2 Sam 7:14; Ps 2:7), functioning as God’s representative rulers. The judges of Israel are called “gods” (Ps 82:6) insofar as they mediated divine justice. These precedents demonstrate that titles and prerogatives associated with God can be extended to God’s human or angelic representatives without infringing monotheism. Within this Jewish conceptual background, Jesus’ being called “Lord” or bearing divine titles can be seen as a recognition of his unique agency rather than as evidence of his ontological deity.

High Christological texts often cited by Trinitarians require reinterpretation within this representational framework. John 1:1–14, frequently marshaled as evidence of Jesus’ pre-existence as the divine Logos, is better understood through the lens of Jewish Wisdom traditions. “In the beginning was the Word” does not refer to a pre-existent person but to God’s creative utterance and purpose. This Word “became flesh” when God’s plan was embodied in the historical Jesus. Similarly, Philippians 2:6–11 is often invoked as proof of Jesus’ divine nature, yet the hymn celebrates Jesus’ obedience and humility: though in the “form of God” (bearing divine authority as Messiah), he did not seize equality with God but humbled himself to death. The exaltation that follows is bestowed by God, not intrinsic to Jesus’ nature, underscoring agency rather than co-equality. Hebrews 1 presents Jesus as superior to angels, but the text grounds his authority in divine appointment, not ontological identity. Even Thomas’ exclamation, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28), can be understood as recognition of Jesus’ unique role as God’s agent and representative, much like earlier figures addressed with divine appellations in Scripture.

A disclaimer must be made here: Trinitarian theologians counter that the accumulated weight of these passages points to more than agency, arguing that Jesus’ worship, pre-existence, and divine attributes cannot be reduced to mere functional representation. Yet such arguments import later doctrinal categories back into the texts, ignoring the Jewish monotheistic framework in which the first believers operated. Worship of Jesus, when understood as honor given to God’s agent, mirrors the veneration shown to the Davidic king or the angel of the Lord without compromising God’s unique divinity. Pre-existence language functions narratively and poetically in Jewish literature to describe foreordination (cf. Jer 1:5) rather than literal pre-incarnation. Thus, the supposed “high Christology” of the New Testament is not a departure from Jewish monotheism but its natural development under the categories of Wisdom and agency.

The implications of this corrected view are significant. To affirm Jesus as God’s Man, the Messiah, rather than as God-Man, re-centers the gospel message on God’s sovereign initiative in raising up and vindicating His chosen servant. It underscores the true humanity of Jesus, his identification with his people, and the reality of his obedience. The cross is not the self-offering of God to God but the faithful obedience of God’s anointed servant. The resurrection is not a divine self-vindication but God’s public declaration that this man is indeed the Messiah, the Son of God, appointed to judge and reign (Acts 2:22–36; 17:31). In this light, the gospel reemerges in its original clarity: the one God of Israel has acted decisively in history by raising up Jesus, the man approved by Him, as Lord and Christ. The believer’s hope is not in metaphysical speculation about divine essence but in trusting the God who sent His agent to accomplish salvation.

In conclusion, a historically grounded reading of the New Testament within the Jewish contexts of Wisdom Christology and the law of agency demonstrates that traditional Trinitarianism, though well-intentioned in defending Christ’s significance, misconstrued the biblical categories and imported alien metaphysical notions into the faith. Jesus is not God in an ontological sense but is God’s supreme agent, the embodiment of His Wisdom and purpose in human history. To recover this understanding is to rediscover the biblical Jesus: the faithful Messiah, the man whom God appointed as Lord, whose mission was to embody God’s will, reveal His character, and inaugurate His kingdom. Such a vision not only restores the gospel to its original Jewish monotheistic foundations but also clarifies for believers today the true meaning of confessing Jesus as Lord—namely, to acknowledge God’s chosen agent who reigns on God’s behalf and leads humanity into covenantal faithfulness with the one true God of Israel.
