In Jewish tradition, the principle of *shaliah* (or *shaliach*), often translated as "agency" or "emissary," is a legal and cultural concept where an agent sent by a principal acts with full authority on their behalf. As articulated in rabbinic sources like the Talmud (e.g., Kiddushin 41b and Nedarim 72b), the core dictum is that "a person's agent is like himself," meaning the agent's words, actions, and decisions are legally binding as if the principal had performed them directly. This extends to representation in transactions, declarations, or missions, where the agent embodies the sender's will and authority without merging identities—the agent remains distinct from the principal. This principle is not just a post-biblical rabbinic development but is reflected in Hebrew Scriptures through examples of sent representatives who carry divine authority.

Biblical precedents illustrate how agents can perform functions typically associated with God, speak as God, and even be addressed with divine titles in a representational capacity, without implying ontological identity with God:

- **Moses as God's agent**: In Exodus 7:1, God tells Moses, "See, I have made you like God [*elohim*] to Pharaoh," empowering him to perform miracles (e.g., turning the Nile to blood in Exodus 7:17-20) that are attributed directly to God. Moses speaks and acts as God's representative, but he is not God Himself—he is subordinate and sent (Exodus 3:10).
- **Judges and leaders**: In Exodus 21:6, 22:8-9, and 22:28, human judges are referred to as *elohim* ("gods") because they administer God's justice and authority. Psalm 82:6 echoes this: "I said, 'You are gods [*elohim*], sons of the Most High,'" applying divine language to those who represent God's will on earth.
- **Kings and the Messiah**: Psalm 45:6-7 addresses a human king (and prophetically the Messiah) as "O God [*elohim*]," due to his anointed role in ruling with God's authority, yet distinguishes him as one whose "God has anointed you." Isaiah 9:6 similarly calls the promised Messiah "Mighty God" (*El Gibbor*) in a representational sense, as he discloses and enacts God's purposes.
- **Angels as agents**: The "Angel of the LORD" often speaks in the first person as God (e.g., Genesis 31:11-13: "I am the God of Bethel"; Exodus 3:2-6, where the angel in the burning bush is equated with God calling to Moses). Yet the angel is a sent messenger, not God ontologically (e.g., Judges 6:11-14). Actions like destroying Sodom are performed by angels but attributed to God (Genesis 19:13, 24-25).
- **Other examples**: Eliezer acts as Abraham's *shaliah* in securing a wife for Isaac (Genesis 24), binding Abraham as if he were present. Joseph is sent by God to Egypt and given Pharaoh-like authority (Genesis 45:5-7), ruling as his representative without being Pharaoh.

Applying this to Jesus (Yeshua in Hebrew), the New Testament portrays him as God's ultimate *shaliah*—repeatedly described as "sent" by the Father (e.g., John 3:17, 5:36-38, 6:38, 8:42, 10:36, 17:3; Galatians 4:4; Hebrews 3:1-2, where he is called the "apostle" [*apostolos*, Greek equivalent of *shaliah*] faithful to the one who appointed him). Under the *shaliah* principle, Jesus can fully represent God's authority, perform divine functions (e.g., forgiving sins in Mark 2:5-10, as God's empowered agent; raising the dead in John 11:43-44, crediting the Father in John 5:19-21), and speak God's words (e.g., "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me" in John 7:16; "I and the Father are one" in John 10:30, meaning unity in agency and purpose, not ontology). This representation allows him to be called "God" in passages like John 20:28 (Thomas: "My Lord and my God"), Hebrews 1:8 ("Your throne, O God"), or Isaiah 9:6, without requiring him to be God ontologically—he is the sent one embodying the sender's will.

Jesus' subordination reinforces this: he prays to the Father (John 17), says "the Father is greater than I" (John 14:28), and submits to God's will (Matthew 26:39; 1 Corinthians 15:28). In John 10:34-36, Jesus directly invokes the *shaliah* logic by quoting Psalm 82:6 to defend his claim to be God's Son, arguing that if mere recipients of God's word can be called "gods," how much more the one sanctified and sent by God.

There is no inherent reason in the *shaliah* principle why Jesus couldn't be called "God" purely representationally, as the agent is functionally "like" the principal. This is precisely how biblical unitarians interpret it: Jesus represents God so fully that he can bear divine titles and exercise divine prerogatives as God's supreme emissary, without being the same being as the Father. However, trinitarian perspectives counter that while agency explains representation, it doesn't negate Jesus' deity—biblical claims of his preexistence (John 1:1-3), role as creator (Colossians 1:16), and direct worship (Revelation 5:12-14) suggest an ontological dimension beyond mere agency, and the full rabbinic *shaliah* law isn't explicitly detailed in Scripture to limit those claims. Traditional Judaism, which rejects Jesus as Messiah, would not apply *shaliah* to elevate him to divine status in any sense, viewing such claims as blasphemous outside biblical precedents.

Ultimately, yes, the *shaliah* principle provides a framework in Jewish thought for understanding Jesus as fully representational of God—acting, speaking, and being addressed as divine—without ontological equality, aligning with unitarian readings of Scripture where the Father alone is the "only true God" (John 17:3).
