# God-Man or God's Man: Church-Traditional Trinitarianism vs. The Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Intertestamental Wisdom Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency during Second Temple Judaism

The theological debate over Jesus Christ's nature—whether he is the God-Man (Trinitarianism) or God's Man (Biblical Unitarianism)—represents one of Christianity's most enduring controversies. This examination explores how Hebrew intertestamental wisdom literature and the Jewish law of agency during Second Temple Judaism provide crucial interpretive frameworks for understanding early Christological development and the ongoing debate between these competing theological positions.

## **The Foundation of Second Temple Jewish Monotheism**

Second Temple Judaism (516 BCE - 70 CE) operated within what scholars call "exclusive monotheism" rather than the inclusive monotheism of surrounding cultures. This exclusive monotheism maintained absolute distinction between the one Creator God and all created beings, yet paradoxically accommodated a rich theological understanding of divine intermediaries and agents. The period witnessed significant development in Jewish thought regarding divine attributes, personified wisdom, and the concept of divine agency through human representatives.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### **The Hierarchy of Divine Beings**

Contrary to modern assumptions about Jewish monotheism being strictly unitarian, Second Temple Judaism embraced "a hierarchy of divine beings, with the one God as the Most High accompanied by a principal divine agent second only in authority to God surrounded by a court of divine beings". This worldview was "universal in Second Temple Judaism—the Judaism that gave rise to Christianity". Such a framework allowed for divine intermediaries and agents while maintaining the supremacy of the one God, providing important precedent for later Christological development.[^4]

The ancient Jewish understanding recognized that "the divine glory could be shared by exalted humans" and "it was a very common belief that humans could ascend to the throne of God and be transformed glory for glory into the same divine image". This theological flexibility created space for understanding how a human figure might participate in divine identity without compromising monotheism.[^4]

## **Hebrew Intertestamental Wisdom Literature**

### **The Personification of Divine Wisdom (Sophia)**

The development of personified Wisdom (Sophia) in intertestamental literature represents a crucial bridge between Hebrew biblical tradition and early Christian Christology. In texts like Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon, and Baruch, Sophia appears not merely as a literary personification but as a divine figure with distinct attributes and functions.[^2][^5][^6]

**Sirach's Contribution**: Ben Sira presents Wisdom as "God's first creature who played an intermediate role in the creation of all things". In Sirach 24, Wisdom describes herself as coming "forth from the mouth of the Most High" and dwelling "in the highest heavens". This portrayal establishes Wisdom as both distinct from yet intimately connected to God's essential nature.[^5][^7]

**Wisdom of Solomon**: This text further develops the concept, presenting Wisdom as "a reflection of eternal light" and describing her as present at creation, guiding humanity in righteousness. The Greek term *apaugasma* (radiance) used here would later be echoed in Hebrews 1:3's description of Christ.[^6]

### **The Torah-Wisdom Connection**

A significant development in this period was the identification of personified Wisdom with Torah. "Both Ben Sira and Baruch had closely associated God's Wisdom with Torah", creating a theological framework where divine revelation took on personified characteristics while maintaining connection to God's covenantal relationship with Israel.[^8]

## **The Jewish Law of Agency (Shaliah)**

### **Fundamental Principles**

The Jewish concept of agency (*shaliah*) provided a crucial interpretive framework for understanding how a human representative could speak and act with divine authority. The principle is encapsulated in the rabbinic dictum: "a person's agent is regarded as the person himself".[^9][^10][^11]

**Key Tenets of Agency**:

1. The agent fully represents the sender
2. The agent speaks only the words given by the sender
3. The agent acts in the sender's name and authority
4. The agent's actions are regarded as the sender's actions
5. The agent does only the sender's will, not his own
6. The sender bears full responsibility for the agent's authorized acts[^12][^9]

### **Biblical Precedents**

The concept finds extensive precedent in Hebrew Scripture, where figures like Moses, the prophets, and various messengers function as God's authorized representatives. These *sheluchim* (sent ones) could speak with divine authority precisely because they operated under the principle of agency, not because they possessed inherent divinity.[^11][^12]

## **Trinitarian Interpretation: The God-Man**

### **Historical Development**

Traditional Trinitarian theology developed through several centuries of theological reflection, crystallizing in the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) and refined through subsequent councils. The doctrine emerged partly in response to various Christological challenges including Arianism, which argued that Christ was a created being rather than eternally divine.[^13][^14][^15][^6]

### **Wisdom Christology in Trinitarian Thought**

Trinitarian theology interprets the personified Wisdom of intertestamental literature as prefiguring the pre-existent divine Word (Logos) who became incarnate in Jesus Christ. This reading sees continuity between Old Testament Wisdom and New Testament Christology, arguing that Jesus is the embodiment of divine Wisdom who participated in creation and now mediates between God and humanity.[^16][^17][^6]

**Supporting Arguments**:

- The parallel language between Proverbs 8 and New Testament descriptions of Christ's role in creation[^18][^19]
- Paul's explicit identification of Christ as "the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:24)[^19][^17]
- The application of divine titles and prerogatives to Jesus throughout the New Testament[^20]


### **Agency and Incarnation**

Trinitarians acknowledge the agency framework but argue it is insufficient to explain the full scope of New Testament Christology. They contend that while Jesus functions as God's agent, the New Testament attributes to him divine prerogatives that exceed mere agency, including the ability to forgive sins, receive worship, and exercise divine authority over creation.[^21][^20]

## **Biblical Unitarian Interpretation: God's Man**

### **Core Principles**

Biblical Unitarianism maintains that Jesus Christ is fully human—God's supreme agent and representative—but not himself divine in essence. This position argues for strict monotheism where only the Father possesses divine nature, while Jesus serves as the ultimate *shaliah* through whom God accomplishes redemption.[^22][^23][^1]

### **Agency as Explanatory Framework**

Biblical Unitarians argue that the Jewish law of agency provides the key to understanding Jesus' relationship to God. Under this framework:[^24][^9][^11]

- Jesus' divine claims are understood as authorized agency statements
- His performance of divine works reflects delegated authority, not inherent divinity
- Worship directed toward Jesus is ultimately worship of the Father who sent him
- Jesus' submission to the Father reflects the proper relationship between agent and sender[^23][^9]


### **Wisdom Literature Interpretation**

Rather than seeing personified Wisdom as a distinct divine person, Biblical Unitarians typically interpret these passages as poetic personification of God's attribute of wisdom. They argue that wisdom literature uses metaphorical language to describe God's wisdom working in creation and history, not to establish a separate divine being.[^25][^1]

**Key Arguments**:

- Wisdom is consistently presented as an attribute or activity of God, not a separate person
- The personification serves rhetorical and theological purposes without requiring literal hypostatization
- Jesus fulfills the role of Wisdom as God's supreme agent, not as Wisdom incarnate[^26][^23]


### **Monotheistic Concerns**

Biblical Unitarians argue that Trinitarian doctrine compromises pure monotheism by introducing complexity into the divine nature that Scripture does not support. They maintain that Second Temple Jewish monotheism, while accommodating divine intermediaries, never crossed the line into attributing essential divinity to created beings.[^27][^23][^20][^26]

## **Scholarly Perspectives and Contemporary Debate**

### **The "New Religionsgeschichtliche Schule"**

Recent scholarship has challenged earlier developmental models of Christology, with scholars like Larry Hurtado, Richard Bauckham, and N.T. Wright arguing for very early "high Christology" that included Jesus within the divine identity. This "Early High Christology Club" maintains that devotion to Jesus as divine emerged immediately within the earliest Christian communities, not through gradual Hellenistic influence.[^28][^29]

### **Divine Identity vs. Divine Agents**

Richard Bauckham's influential work distinguishes between divine identity and divine agency in Second Temple Judaism. He argues that while Judaism recognized many divine agents, only the one God of Israel possessed the unique divine identity characterized by being the sole Creator and sovereign Ruler of all things. According to this view, the New Testament includes Jesus within this unique divine identity rather than merely presenting him as another divine agent.[^29]

### **Ongoing Scholarly Debate**

Contemporary scholarship remains divided on these questions, with ongoing debates about:

- The nature of Second Temple Jewish monotheism and its flexibility regarding divine intermediaries[^30][^31][^4]
- The relationship between wisdom Christology and incarnational theology[^3][^2][^18]
- The adequacy of agency models for explaining New Testament Christology[^32][^24][^21]
- The historical development of Trinitarian doctrine and its biblical foundations[^14][^33][^13]


## **Theological and Practical Implications**

### **Soteriological Questions**

The debate carries significant implications for understanding salvation. Trinitarians argue that only a divine Christ can accomplish redemption that bridges the infinite gap between God and humanity. Biblical Unitarians counter that God can accomplish salvation through his appointed human agent without requiring divine incarnation.[^23][^20][^26]

### **Worship and Devotion**

The question of whether worship should be directed to Jesus remains contentious. Trinitarians see such worship as appropriate recognition of Christ's divine nature, while Biblical Unitarians argue that proper worship acknowledges Jesus as God's supreme representative while ultimately directing praise to the Father.[^34][^23]

### **Missionary and Interfaith Implications**

The debate has practical consequences for Christian engagement with Jewish and Muslim communities, both of which maintain strict monotheism. Some argue that Biblical Unitarian presentations of Jesus might be more acceptable to these monotheistic faiths, potentially removing barriers to gospel acceptance.[^23]

## **Conclusion**

The debate between Trinitarian and Biblical Unitarian interpretations of Jesus Christ cannot be easily resolved through appeal to Second Temple Jewish precedents alone. Both positions find support in the complex theological landscape of intertestamental Judaism, with its sophisticated understanding of divine agency, personified wisdom, and flexible monotheism that could accommodate divine intermediaries while maintaining God's unique supremacy.

The Hebrew wisdom literature provides rich theological resources that both traditions continue to mine for insights into Christ's nature and work. Whether interpreted as prefiguring divine incarnation or as establishing patterns of divine agency, these texts remain central to ongoing Christological reflection.

Similarly, the Jewish law of agency offers valuable insights into how divine authority can be mediated through human representatives, though scholars continue to debate whether this framework adequately explains the full scope of New Testament claims about Jesus Christ.

Ultimately, this theological debate reflects deeper questions about the nature of divine revelation, the relationship between unity and diversity in God's nature, and the means by which the transcendent God engages with created reality. As both Trinitarian and Biblical Unitarian scholars continue to engage with Second Temple Jewish sources, the conversation remains vibrant and consequential for Christian theology and practice.

The question of whether Jesus is God-Man or God's Man may never achieve universal consensus, but the ongoing dialogue enriches our understanding of both the Jewish contexts that shaped early Christianity and the enduring significance of Christological reflection for faith communities today.
