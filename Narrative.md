# The Biblical Jesus: God's Agent, Not God Himself

The identity of Jesus Christ has stirred deep theological debate for centuries. While traditional Trinitarianism declares Jesus as the second person of a coequal, coeternal triune God, a growing number of Christians are rediscovering a simpler, more biblical view: that Jesus is not God, but God's supreme agent. This view, known as Biblical Unitarianism, affirms the full humanity of Jesus while recognizing his exalted role in God’s plan. Two central pillars support this understanding: the Jewish principle of "shaliah" (agency) and the concept of Wisdom Christology.

In Jewish thought, a shaliah is a legally appointed agent who acts on behalf of another with full authority. As the Talmud says, "A person's agent is like the person himself" (Mishnah, Berakhot 5:5). This means someone sent by another can speak and act in their name. In Scripture, God often sent messengers to represent Him: Moses is called "God to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1); angels speak in the first person as God; and judges in Israel are called "gods" (Psalm 82:6) because they carry divine authority. These figures were never thought to be God Himself, but functioned as His agents.

Jesus fits perfectly into this tradition. In John’s Gospel alone, he is said to be "sent" by the Father nearly 40 times. Jesus says, "The one who receives me receives the one who sent me" (John 13:20), echoing the shaliah principle. He acts, speaks, and judges on God's behalf, not as an equal, but as a faithful representative. In John 17:3, Jesus distinguishes himself clearly from the "only true God," affirming that eternal life comes from knowing the Father and Jesus as His Messiah.

What about the passages that seem to say Jesus is God? For instance, John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God, and the Word was God." But here, Biblical Unitarians argue that "the Word" (Greek: logos) refers not to a second divine person but to God's wisdom, plan, or self-expression—something impersonal that became flesh in Jesus (John 1:14). This ties directly to Wisdom Christology, a tradition that personifies God's wisdom in Proverbs 8, Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. These texts describe Wisdom as present at creation and later dwelling among humans—not as a literal person, but as a poetic way of speaking about God's creative and redemptive intentions. Jesus is the embodiment of this wisdom, the living expression of God’s will.

Other so-called high Christology passages also align with this view when interpreted contextually. Philippians 2 speaks of Jesus "being in the form of God" yet humbling himself. Rather than suggesting preexistence in heaven, it portrays Jesus as a human who had divine authority but chose servanthood. Colossians 1 describes Jesus as "firstborn of all creation" and the one through whom all things were created. Biblical Unitarians understand this as Jesus being central in God's new creation, the church, and that "all things" refers to roles and powers within that new order—not the original creation of the universe.

In Revelation 3:14, Jesus is called "the beginning of God's creation," a phrase more likely referring to his role as the inaugurator of the new creation rather than an eternal divine being. These reinterpretations are not theological gymnastics but grounded in Jewish concepts of agency and in the poetic, metaphorical language common to ancient texts.

Understanding Jesus as God's appointed Messiah, rather than God Himself, also restores the original gospel message. The apostles preached not a complex Trinitarian formula but "Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16), a man "attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs" (Acts 2:22). Jesus’ mission was to proclaim the Kingdom of God, call people to repentance, and offer himself as a sacrifice for sin—all under the authority of his Father.

This view doesn't diminish Jesus; it exalts the one true God who raised a human being from the dead and gave him authority over heaven and earth. It also restores clarity to Christian worship: we worship God through His Messiah, just as the early Christians did. By embracing the Jewish understanding of agency and the rich metaphors of Wisdom literature, we rediscover the true gospel and the true Jesus—not God the Son, but the Son of God.
