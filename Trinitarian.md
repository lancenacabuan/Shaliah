# [Trinitarian] Reaction Paper: *God-Man or God’s Man?*

## Church–Traditional Trinitarianism vs. the Biblical Unitarian View of Jesus Christ in the Context of Hebrew Wisdom-Literature Christology and the Jewish Law of Agency

This dissertation contrasts the Church’s traditional Trinitarian Christology with the Biblical Unitarian view, situating both in the context of Hebrew Wisdom literature and the Jewish law of agency. Reading it from a Trinitarian perspective reaffirms the profound conviction that Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully man, the eternal Son who reveals the Father and accomplishes redemption.

### Preserving the Fullness of God’s Self-Revelation

Trinitarian theology begins with the recognition that the New Testament consistently presents Jesus not only as Messiah but also as divine. The author acknowledges passages such as John 1:1 and Philippians 2:6–11, which ascribe to Jesus attributes belonging uniquely to God. From the Trinitarian perspective, these cannot be reduced merely to metaphor or agency; they testify to the mystery of the Word made flesh (John 1:14). To see Jesus only as God’s agent risks diminishing the fullness of God’s self-revelation in Christ.

### Wisdom Fulfilled in the Incarnate Word

The discussion of Wisdom literature is especially important. While Biblical Unitarians read Proverbs 8 as mere personification, Trinitarians understand it as pointing to a deeper reality. When Paul calls Christ “the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor. 1:24), he identifies Jesus with the eternal Wisdom that was with God from the beginning. The Wisdom tradition does not stand apart from God but is an expression of His being — fulfilled in the Son, who is “the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature” (Heb. 1:3 NASB1995). In this way, the personified Wisdom finds its true embodiment in Christ, not as a poetic metaphor, but as a living reality.

### Beyond Agency: Sonship and Ontological Unity

The law of agency sheds light on Jesus’ mission, but Trinitarian faith affirms that Jesus is more than an agent. He is the beloved Son, sharing in the very nature of the Father (John 10:30). Agency can explain how Jesus represents God, but it cannot account for the worship he receives, nor the divine prerogatives he exercises. Thomas’s confession, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28), illustrates that the early disciples recognized in Jesus not merely God’s representative but God Himself revealed.

### Historical Continuity of the Faith

The dissertation highlights the historical development of the doctrine of the Trinity, yet from a Trinitarian perspective, this development reflects faithful clarification rather than invention. The councils of Nicaea and Constantinople did not create new doctrine; they articulated in precise terms the truths already embedded in Scripture and confessed in worship. Far from being a departure from apostolic faith, Trinitarianism safeguards the confession that Jesus is “true God from true God,” ensuring that salvation rests not in a mere man but in God Himself entering into our humanity.

### Contemporary Relevance

The conclusion rightly points to interfaith dialogue, but Trinitarians affirm that the uniqueness of Christian faith lies precisely in the incarnation. God has not only sent a messenger but has come Himself in the Son to redeem humanity. This is what makes Christianity distinct and transformative: the God who is love reveals Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit, drawing us into communion with Him.

### Conclusion

Engaging this dissertation from a Trinitarian standpoint underscores that Jesus Christ cannot be reduced to God’s man alone; He is truly the God-Man. The themes of Wisdom and agency enrich our understanding, but they find their ultimate meaning in the eternal Son who took on flesh for our salvation. The doctrine of the Trinity is not a philosophical burden but the church’s faithful witness to the God revealed in Christ and experienced through the Spirit.
